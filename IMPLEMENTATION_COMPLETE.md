# Advanced Scraping Strategy - Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete  
**Branch:** agent

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented a multi-tier web scraping system with environment-aware constraints, stealth plugins, and proper dependency management for both AWS Lambda (production) and local development environments.

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### 1. **Tier Scraper Implementations**

All five tiers have been implemented with proper stealth plugins and anti-detection measures:

#### ✅ Tier 0: Direct HTTP (`src/scrapers/tier-0-direct.js`)
- **Technology**: Axios/Fetch
- **Stealth Level**: Basic (HTTP headers)
- **Environment**: Production Lambda ✅ + Local ✅
- **Features**:
  - User-agent spoofing
  - Custom headers
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - DuckDuckGo proxy support
  - Tavily API fallback

#### ✅ Tier 1: Puppeteer + Stealth (`src/scrapers/tier-1-puppeteer.js`)
- **Technology**: `puppeteer-extra` + `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth`
- **Stealth Level**: Advanced
- **Environment**: Production Lambda ✅ + Local ✅
- **Features**:
  - 🔒 **CRITICAL**: Uses `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth` (NOT standard Puppeteer)
  - Lambda-compatible with `@sparticuz/chromium`
  - Headless Chrome with anti-detection
  - Custom user agents and viewport
  - Resource blocking for performance
  - Screenshot capability

#### ✅ Tier 2: Playwright + Stealth (`src/scrapers/tier-2-playwright.js`)
- **Technology**: `playwright-extra` + `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth`
- **Stealth Level**: Advanced
- **Environment**: Local Only ⚠️
- **Features**:
  - 🔒 Uses Playwright-Extra with stealth plugin
  - Multi-browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
  - Advanced anti-detection
  - Screenshot capability
  - Interactive JavaScript execution

#### ✅ Tier 3: Selenium + Undetected-ChromeDriver (`src/scrapers/tier-3-selenium.js`)
- **Technology**: Python's `undetected-chromedriver`
- **Stealth Level**: Maximum
- **Environment**: Local Only ⚠️
- **Features**:
  - 🔒 **MOST ADVANCED**: Uses `undetected-chromedriver` (Python)
  - Bypasses Cloudflare "Checking your browser" challenges
  - Handles Distil Networks and aggressive bot detection
  - Node.js wrapper for Python process
  - JSON communication between Node and Python

#### ✅ Tier 4: Interactive Mode (`src/scrapers/tier-4-interactive.js`)
- **Technology**: Playwright (non-headless)
- **Stealth Level**: Human
- **Environment**: Local Only ⚠️
- **Features**:
  - Manual CAPTCHA solving
  - Manual login handling
  - Visual debugging
  - Full browser control

### 2. **Tier Orchestrator** (`src/scrapers/tier-orchestrator.js`)

✅ Enhanced with:
- Environment-aware tier constraints
- Automatic fallback chain (0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
- Error analysis and escalation logic
- Lambda limitation detection and user guidance
- Login requirement detection
- Dynamic tier availability checking

### 3. **Python Integration** (`scripts/undetected-chrome.py`)

✅ Created Python wrapper for Tier 3:
- Standalone Python script using `undetected-chromedriver`
- JSON-based communication with Node.js
- Supports headless and headed modes
- Comprehensive error handling
- Metadata extraction (title, HTML, text, links, meta tags)

### 4. **Deployment Scripts**

#### ✅ `scripts/setup-dev.sh`
- Installs all npm dependencies (production + dev)
- Sets up Python virtual environment
- Installs `undetected-chromedriver` and `selenium`
- Installs Playwright browsers (Chromium, Firefox)
- Creates `.env` file with proper configuration
- Clear messaging about available tiers

#### ✅ `scripts/deploy-production.sh`
- Verifies only production dependencies
- Checks for local-only packages in dependencies
- Validates required stealth plugins
- Production-only npm install
- Deploys to Lambda with size constraints respected
- Shows tier limitation warnings

### 5. **Dependency Management**

#### Production Dependencies (Lambda-compatible)
```json
{
  "puppeteer-extra": "^3.3.6",
  "puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth": "^2.11.2",
  "puppeteer-core": "^23.11.1",
  "@sparticuz/chromium": "^131.0.0",
  "axios": "^1.6.2"
}
```

#### Development Dependencies (Local-only)

  "chromedriver": "^120.0.1"
}
```

#### Python Dependencies (Local-only)

```

### 6. **Makefile Targets**

Added comprehensive scraping targets:

```bash
# Setup
make setup-scraping           # Complete environment setup
make install-playwright       # Install Playwright browsers

### 8. **Package.json Scripts**

```json
{
  "setup": "./scripts/setup-dev.sh",
  "deploy:production": "./scripts/deploy-production.sh",
  "test:scraping": "node tests/test-tier-orchestrator.js",
  "test:tiers": "jest tests/tier",
  "install:playwright": "npx playwright install chromium firefox",
  "install:python": "python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install undetected-chromedriver selenium"
}
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Initial Setup (One-time)

```bash
# Setup everything (npm + Python + Playwright)
make setup-scraping

# Or use npm script
npm run setup
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Test all tiers
make test-tiers

# Test specific tier
make test-tier-1

# Run full scraping integration test
npm run test:scraping
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to production Lambda (only Tier 0-1)
make deploy-lambda

# Or use deployment script
npm run deploy:production
```

## 📋 Environment Variables

### `.env` Configuration

```bash
# Development mode (enables local-only tiers)
NODE_ENV=development

# Scraping settings
HEADLESS=true
USE_PUPPETEER=true

# Tier control (1 for Lambda, 4 for local)
SCRAPING_MAX_TIER=4
SCRAPING_ENABLE_INTERACTIVE=true

# Python environment (for Tier 3 - Selenium)
PYTHON_VENV_PATH=./.venv
```

## 🔒 Stealth Plugin Verification

### Tier 1 Verification
✅ Uses `puppeteer-extra` (NOT standard Puppeteer)  
✅ Applies `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth`  
✅ Lambda-compatible with `@sparticuz/chromium`

### Tier 2 Verification
✅ Uses `playwright-extra`  
✅ Applies `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth` (compatible with Playwright)  
⚠️ Local-only (not Lambda-compatible)

### Tier 3 Verification
✅ Uses Python's `undetected-chromedriver`  
✅ Most advanced anti-detection  
⚠️ Local-only (requires Python + large Chrome binary)

## 📦 Deployment Package Size

### Production Lambda (Tier 0-1 only)
- **Dependencies**: ~50MB (zipped)
- **Includes**: puppeteer-extra, stealth plugin, chromium binary
- **Excludes**: Playwright, Selenium, Python packages

### Local Development (All Tiers 0-4)
- **Dependencies**: ~500MB (unzipped)
- **Includes**: All production + development dependencies
- **Python venv**: ~100MB

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Lambda Limitations**:
   - Only Tier 0 (Direct) and Tier 1 (Puppeteer) work on Lambda
   - Tier 2-4 require local execution
   - Tier orchestrator provides clear error messages when limits exceeded

2. **Stealth Plugin Requirements**:
   - Tier 1 MUST use `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth`
   - Standard Puppeteer does NOT have stealth capabilities
   - Tier 2 uses same stealth plugin with Playwright-Extra adapter
   - Tier 3 uses Python's `undetected-chromedriver` (different implementation)

3. **Python Environment**:
   - Tier 3 requires Python 3.8+
   - Uses virtual environment (`.venv/`)
   - Automatically activated by setup script

4. **Dependency Separation**:
   - Production dependencies: Lambda-compatible only
   - devDependencies: Local-only (Playwright, Selenium, etc.)
   - Deployment script verifies separation before deployment

## 🎉 Status

**Implementation: 100% Complete**

All components are implemented and ready for testing. Run `make setup-scraping` to get started!

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies**: `make setup-scraping`
2. **Run tests**: `make test-tiers`
3. **Test scraping**: `npm run test:scraping`
4. **Deploy to Lambda**: `make deploy-lambda`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Dependencies not installed
```bash
npm install
make setup-scraping
```

### Python environment issues
```bash
make install-python
source .venv/bin/activate
pip list
```

### Playwright browsers missing
```bash
make install-playwright
```

### Tier 2/3/4 not working on Lambda
This is expected! These tiers are local-only. Use Tier 0 or Tier 1 on Lambda.
