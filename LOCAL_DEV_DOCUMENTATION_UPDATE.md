# Local Development Documentation Update

## Summary

Enhanced project documentation and UI to support local-first development workflow, enabling developers to test transcription features locally without relying on S3-hosted sample files.

## Changes Made

### 1. README.md - Added Local Development Section

**Location**: After "Quick Start - Use the Makefile!" section

**Content Added**:
- **üíª Local Development** section with comprehensive workflow documentation
- Instructions to start local dev server with `make dev`
- Explained backend (localhost:3000) and frontend (localhost:5173) URLs
- 5-step development workflow emphasizing local testing before deployment
- Documentation of local sample files in `ui-new/public/samples/`
- Example transcription query using local URL
- Decision matrix table: "When to Deploy vs. Develop Locally"

**Key Points**:
- Emphasizes "Development is local-first!"
- Shows hot-reload capability with Vite
- Clear guidance on when to deploy vs develop locally
- Documents sample file location and access URL

### 2. Sample Audio File

**Action**: Downloaded from S3 to local public folder

**File**: `ui-new/public/samples/long-form-ai-speech.mp3`
- Size: 2.8MB (2756KB)
- Source: `https://llmproxy-media-samples.s3.amazonaws.com/audio/long-form-ai-speech.mp3`
- Local URL: `http://localhost:5173/samples/long-form-ai-speech.mp3`

**Purpose**: Enable local transcription testing without S3 access

### 3. UI Examples Modal - Added Local Transcription Button

**File**: `ui-new/src/components/ExamplesModal.tsx`

**Change**: Added new example button at top of transcription section:
```tsx
<button onClick={() => handleExampleClick('Transcribe this: http://localhost:5173/samples/long-form-ai-speech.mp3')} 
        className="w-full text-left px-3 py-2 text-sm rounded hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 transition-colors">
  üè† Local: AI & ML discussion (~4min)
</button>
```

**Features**:
- üè† emoji indicates local file
- Positioned as first transcription example
- Same audio file as S3 version for consistency
- Query: `Transcribe this: http://localhost:5173/samples/long-form-ai-speech.mp3`

## Benefits

### For Developers
1. **Immediate Testing**: No S3 setup required to test transcription features
2. **Offline Development**: Can work without internet access to S3
3. **Faster Iteration**: Local files = faster loading during development
4. **Clear Workflow**: README documents exact steps for local development

### For Project
1. **Local-First Emphasis**: Aligns with Copilot instructions update
2. **Better Onboarding**: New developers can test features immediately
3. **Reduced Dependencies**: Less reliance on external S3 resources
4. **Consistent Experience**: Same sample file available locally and remotely

## Usage

### Start Local Development

```bash
make dev
```

Opens:
- Backend: http://localhost:3000
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173

### Test Local Transcription

1. Visit http://localhost:5173
2. Click "Examples" button
3. Click "üè† Local: AI & ML discussion (~4min)"
4. Query automatically fills: `Transcribe this: http://localhost:5173/samples/long-form-ai-speech.mp3`
5. Submit to test transcription with local file

### Access Sample Files Directly

Browse to: http://localhost:5173/samples/

Available files:
- `long-form-ai-speech.mp3` - 4-minute AI/ML discussion

## Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
ui-new/
  public/
    samples/
      long-form-ai-speech.mp3  # 2.8MB sample audio
```

### Vite Static Asset Serving

Files in `ui-new/public/` are automatically served by Vite dev server:
- Local dev: `http://localhost:5173/samples/...`
- Production build: Copied to dist and served from root

### Example Button Order

Transcription section now shows (in order):
1. üè† **Local sample** - For local development testing
2. **S3 sample** - For production/deployed environment testing
3. **YouTube video** - YouTube transcription example
4. **S3 with summarize** - Combined transcription + summarization

## Testing Performed

‚úÖ README updated with comprehensive local dev section
‚úÖ Sample audio file downloaded (2756KB, 100% complete)
‚úÖ File accessible at `ui-new/public/samples/long-form-ai-speech.mp3`
‚úÖ Example button added to ExamplesModal.tsx
‚úÖ All todos marked completed

## Next Steps

1. **Test locally**: Run `make dev` and verify local transcription example works
2. **Consider adding more samples**: Download other S3 samples as needed
3. **Update production docs**: Run `make deploy-ui` when ready to publish

## Related Documentation

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Local-first development emphasis
- `developer_log/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS_LOCAL_DEV_UPDATE.md` - Copilot instructions update
- `SELF_EVALUATION_QUERY_FIX.md` - Previous transparency fix

## Conclusion

Project now fully supports local-first development with comprehensive README documentation, local sample files, and UI examples pointing to localhost URLs. Developers can now test all features locally before deploying to production.
