## Architecture

### Sender (Web App) Flow

```
User clicks Cast button
  ‚Üì
GoogleLoginButton calls requestSession()
  ‚Üì
CastContext initializes Google Cast session
  ‚Üì
User selects Chromecast device from dialog
  ‚Üì
Session established
  ‚Üì
ChatTab useEffect detects isCastConnected = true
  ‚Üì
Automatically sends current messages via sendCastMessages()
  ‚Üì
Messages continuously synced on every update
```

### Receiver (TV) Flow

```
Chromecast device receives cast request
  ‚Üì
Loads chromecast-receiver.html from app URL
  ‚Üì
Receiver initializes Cast Receiver Framework
  ‚Üì
Listens for messages on custom namespace
  ‚Üì
Receives MESSAGES_UPDATE events
  ‚Üì
Renders messages with TV-optimized styling
  ‚Üì
Auto-scrolls to bottom (synchronized)
```

### Message Protocol

**Custom Namespace**: `urn:x-cast:com.lambdallmproxy.chat`

**Message Types**:

1. **MESSAGES_UPDATE**
```json
{
  "type": "MESSAGES_UPDATE",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user" | "assistant" | "tool",
      "content": "message text",
      "name": "tool_name", // for tool messages
      "tool_call_id": "id", // for tool messages
      "isStreaming": true | false
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **SCROLL_UPDATE** (future enhancement)
```json
{
  "type": "SCROLL_UPDATE",
  "position": 1234 // scroll position in pixels
}
```

## Google Cast Console Registration

### IMPORTANT: Application Registration Required

The current implementation uses the **default media receiver** for development. For production, you MUST register a custom receiver application.

### Steps to Register:

1. **Go to Google Cast Console**:
   - Visit: https://cast.google.com/publish/
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Create New Application**:
   - Click "New Application"
   - Select "Custom Receiver"
   - Name: "LLM Proxy Chat Receiver"
   - Receiver Application URL: `https://syntithenai.github.io/lambdallmproxy/chromecast-receiver.html`

3. **Configure Settings**:
   - Guest Mode: Enabled (allows casting without same WiFi network)
   - Category: Communications
   - Description: "Cast LLM chat conversations to your TV"

4. **Get Application ID**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - Application ID: `DE7507EF`
   - Status: Registered and deployed

5. **Update Code**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - Updated `ui-new/src/contexts/CastContext.tsx`
   - Application ID set to: `DE7507EF`
   - Deployed to GitHub Pages

6. **Publish Application**: ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
   - In Cast Console, click "Publish"
   - Wait for Google approval (usually 1-2 days)
   - Once approved, your receiver is live

### Testing Before Registration

You can test with the default media receiver (limited functionality):
- Click Cast button
- Select your Chromecast device
- The receiver will load but may show media controls instead of chat messages
- Full functionality requires custom receiver registration

---

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Update Application ID ‚úÖ COMPLETE

Application ID `DE7507EF` has been configured in `ui-new/src/contexts/CastContext.tsx` and deployed to production.

### 2. Build and Deploy UI

```bash
# From project root
make deploy-ui
```

This will:
- Build React app from `ui-new/`
- Generate static files in `docs/`
- Include `chromecast-receiver.html` in deployment
- Commit and push to GitHub Pages

### 3. Verify Receiver URL

After deployment, receiver should be accessible at:
```
https://syntithenai.github.io/lambdallmproxy/chromecast-receiver.html
```

Test by visiting URL in browser - should show:
```
ü§ñ LLM Proxy Chat
Chromecast Receiver
üí¨ Waiting for messages...
```

### 4. Test Casting

1. Open web app: `https://syntithenai.github.io/lambdallmproxy/`
2. Sign in with Google
3. Look for Cast button next to Sign Out
4. Click Cast button
5. Select Chromecast device from dialog
6. Chat messages should appear on TV

---

## User Guide

### How to Use Chromecast Feature

1. **Connect to Same Network**:
   - Ensure your computer and Chromecast device are on the same WiFi network
   - Chromecast must be powered on and connected to TV

2. **Start Casting**:
   - Open the LLM Proxy web app
   - Sign in to your account
   - Look for the Cast button (üì°) in the top-right header, next to Sign Out
   - Click the Cast button
   - Select your Chromecast device from the dialog

3. **View on TV**:
   - Your TV should display the chat interface
   - Only messages are shown (no input box, no controls)
   - Messages auto-scroll as new messages arrive

4. **Continue Chatting**:
   - Type messages in the web app as normal
   - Messages appear instantly on TV
   - Scroll position syncs between devices

5. **Stop Casting**:
   - Click the Cast button again (now blue with device name)
   - Or disconnect from the Chromecast device menu on TV

### What's Shown on TV

**Included**:
- ‚úÖ User messages (blue bubble, right-aligned)

## Technical Details

### Google Cast SDK Integration

**Sender SDK** (Web App):
- Loaded via script tag: `https://www.gstatic.com/cv/js/sender/v1/cast_sender.js?loadCastFramework=1`
- Initialized in `CastContext.tsx`
- Discovers Cast devices on local network
- Manages session lifecycle

**Receiver SDK** (TV App):
- Loaded via script tag: `//www.gstatic.com/cast/sdk/libs/caf_receiver/v3/cast_receiver_framework.js`
- Initializes Cast Receiver Framework
- Listens on custom namespace
- Handles sender disconnection gracefully

### Performance Considerations

**Message Synchronization**:
- Messages sent only when Cast session is active
- Debounced via React's `useEffect` dependency array
- No performance impact when not casting

**Receiver Optimization**:
- Smooth scrolling with CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth`
- Hardware-accelerated animations
- Efficient DOM updates (full re-render on message change)
- 1-hour idle timeout to prevent receiver hanging

**Network Usage**:
- Minimal bandwidth (text-only messages)
- No images/media sent to receiver
- Local network communication (no internet required after initial load)

---

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Default Receiver Used**: Using default media receiver until custom app is registered
2. **No Manual Scroll Control**: Receiver always auto-scrolls to bottom
3. **No Message History Navigation**: Can't scroll back to older messages during cast
4. **Single Session**: Only one sender can cast at a time
5. **No Image Support**: Images in messages not displayed on receiver (text only)

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Image Display**:
   - Send image URLs to receiver
   - Display inline images in chat messages

2. **Manual Scroll Sync**:
   - Detect manual scroll on sender
   - Send scroll position to receiver
   - Pause auto-scroll when user scrolls up

3. **Multi-Sender Support**:
   - Allow multiple senders to view same cast
   - Display sender name/avatar for each message

4. **Voice Commands**:
   - "Hey Google, cast chat to living room TV"
   - "Hey Google, stop casting"

5. **Receiver Customization**:
   - Theme selection (dark/light/custom colors)
   - Font size adjustment
   - Message animation speed

6. **Session Persistence**:
   - Save cast session state
   - Resume cast after page reload

## Troubleshooting

### Cast Button Not Visible

**Problem**: Cast button doesn't appear in header

**Solutions**:
1. Check if Chromecast device is powered on and connected to TV
2. Ensure computer and Chromecast are on same WiFi network
3. Wait 10-15 seconds after page load for Cast SDK to initialize
4. Check browser console for Cast SDK errors
5. Verify Cast SDK loaded: Open DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Look for `cast_sender.js`

### Can't Connect to Chromecast

**Problem**: Cast dialog appears but can't connect to device

**Solutions**:
1. Restart Chromecast device (unplug for 10 seconds)
2. Restart WiFi router
3. Check firewall settings (allow mDNS/port 8008-8009)
4. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
5. Check Cast device firmware is up to date

### Messages Not Appearing on TV

## Code Examples

### Using Cast in Other Components

```tsx
import { useCast } from '../contexts/CastContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { isAvailable, isConnected, deviceName, requestSession, endSession } = useCast();

  return (
    <div>
      {isAvailable && (
        <button onClick={requestSession}>
          {isConnected ? `Casting to ${deviceName}` : 'Start Casting'}
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Sending Custom Messages to Receiver

```tsx
const { session } = useCast();

// Send custom message
if (session) {
  const namespace = 'urn:x-cast:com.lambdallmproxy.chat';
  const message = {
    type: 'CUSTOM_EVENT',
    data: { foo: 'bar' }
  };
  
  session.sendMessage(
    namespace,
    message,
    () => console.log('Message sent'),
    (error) => console.error('Error:', error)
  );
}
```

### Customizing Receiver Appearance

Edit `chromecast-receiver.html` CSS:

```css
/* Change background gradient */
body {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #YOUR_COLOR1 0%, #YOUR_COLOR2 100%);
}

/* Change message bubble colors */
.message.user .message-content {
  background: rgba(YOUR_R, YOUR_G, YOUR_B, 0.3);
}

/* Adjust font sizes */
.message-content {
  font-size: 32px; /* Larger for bigger TVs */
}
```

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Performance

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Cast Connection Time | <3s | Device discovery + handshake |
| Message Sync Latency | <100ms | Local network only |
| Receiver Load Time | <2s | Initial HTML/CSS/JS load |
| Message Render Time | <50ms | Per message, including animation |
| Memory Usage (Receiver) | <50MB | For 100+ messages |
| CPU Usage (Receiver) | <5% | Idle state on TV |

### Optimization Tips

1. **Reduce Message Size**: Strip unnecessary fields before sending
2. **Batch Updates**: Send multiple messages in single update
3. **Lazy Rendering**: Only render visible messages (for 1000+ messages)
4. **Debounce Sync**: Don't sync on every keystroke during streaming

---

## Security Considerations

### Current Security

- ‚úÖ Local network only (no internet exposure)
- ‚úÖ Requires same WiFi network as Chromecast
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data logged to console
- ‚úÖ No API keys sent to receiver
- ‚úÖ Messages filtered before sending (only role/content/name)

### Security Best Practices

1. **Don't Send Sensitive Data**: Strip API keys, tokens, credentials
2. **Validate Messages**: Check message format before rendering
3. **Sanitize HTML**: Escape user-generated content
4. **Limit Message Size**: Prevent memory exhaustion
5. **Session Timeout**: Auto-disconnect after inactivity
