# 🤖 COPILOT UI AUTOMATION INSTRUCTIONS

## 🎯 CRITICAL WORKFLOW FOR ALL UI CHANGES

### STEP 1: IDENTIFY UI CHANGE TYPE
When user requests UI changes, determine:
- HTML structure changes → Edit `ui/index_template_modular.html`
- JavaScript functionality → Edit appropriate file in `ui/js/`
- CSS styling → Edit `ui/css/styles.css`

### STEP 2: APPLY CHANGES TO SOURCE FILES
**NEVER EDIT GENERATED FILES!** Always edit source files in `ui/` folder:

```
ui/
├── index_template_modular.html    # ← HTML changes here
├── css/styles.css                # ← CSS changes here  
└── js/
    ├── utils.js                  # ← Real-time monitoring, utilities
    ├── settings.js               # ← Settings dialog, API keys (MUST load before auth.js)
    ├── auth.js                   # ← Authentication, Google OAuth
    ├── samples.js                # ← Sample queries, query persistence
    ├── events.js                 # ← Event processing, streaming
    ├── streaming.js              # ← Streaming response handling
    └── main.js                   # ← Main app logic, form handling
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL: JavaScript Loading Order**
The script loading order in `index_template_modular.html` is:
1. `utils.js` - Core utilities
2. `settings.js` - **MUST be before auth.js** (contains `updateSubmitButton`)
3. `auth.js` - Calls functions from settings.js
4. Other modules

Never change this order without understanding dependencies!

### STEP 3: REBUILD AUTOMATICALLY
After making ANY UI changes, ALWAYS run:
```bash
cd /home/stever/projects/lambdallmproxy
bash scripts/build-docs.sh
```

### STEP 4: TEST IN BUILT VERSION
Test changes at: `http://localhost:8081/docs/index.html`

---

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN ACTIONS
- ❌ Never edit `docs/index.html` directly
- ❌ Never edit `test.html` for production changes  
- ❌ Never make UI changes without rebuilding
- ❌ Never assume changes work without testing built version

## ✅ REQUIRED ACTIONS  
- ✅ Always edit `ui/` source files
- ✅ Always run `bash scripts/build-docs.sh` after changes
- ✅ Always test in `docs/index.html` (built version)
- ✅ Always preserve existing functionality when adding features

---

## 🔄 AUTOMATION COMMANDS

### Quick UI Development
```bash
# Build only
./scripts/ui-dev.sh build

# Build and test locally  
./scripts/ui-dev.sh test

# Watch for changes (if inotify available)
./scripts/ui-dev.sh watch

# Build and deploy to production
./scripts/ui-dev.sh deploy
```



## 🆘 EMERGENCY RECOVERY
If UI breaks after changes:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify all files exist in `ui/` folder
3. Rebuild: `bash scripts/build-docs.sh`
4. If still broken, revert changes and rebuild
5. Check syntax in template files

---

**🎯 REMEMBER: Source files in `ui/` → Build → Test in `docs/`**

1. Whenever you run a command in the terminal, pipe the output to a file, output.txt, that you can read from.
2. You should read the output.txt file to see the results of your commands.
3. Make sure to overwrite each time so that it doesn't grow too big.
4. There is a bug in the current version of Copilot that causes it to not read the output of commands correctly.
5. This workaround allows you to read the output from the temporary file instead.

3. When sending a test to the llamda function, ensure all parameters are included including api key unless the test requires the exclusion of parameters
