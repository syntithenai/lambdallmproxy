### ❌ What's Blocking Logs

**ONLY ONE ISSUE: Google Sheets API is not enabled**

## 🚨 ACTION REQUIRED

### Enable Google Sheets API (2 minutes)

**Click this link and click "Enable":**
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/sheets.googleapis.com/overview?project=927667106833

**Or manually:**
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Select project: **abc2book**
3. Go to: **APIs & Services** → **Library**
4. Search: "Google Sheets API"
5. Click **ENABLE**
6. Wait 1-2 minutes

### Share Your Sheet

After enabling the API, make sure your sheet is shared with:
```
llamdallmproxy-log@abc2book.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

**Your sheet:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i0wNrPjMh21-1TIsAUZbYwV_c30A4-g39m4rJ-zr9Fw/edit

1. Click **Share** button
2. Add the email above
3. Set permission: **Editor**
4. Click **Done**

## 🧪 Verify Setup

After enabling the API and sharing the sheet, run:

```bash
node test-sheets-diagnostic.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ All checks passed! Logging is ready to use.
```

Then run:
```bash
node test-sheets-init.js
```

To add headers to your sheet.

## 📊 Test Production

Make a chat request through your UI and check:
1. CloudWatch logs: `make logs`
2. Your Google Sheet for a new row

## 🔍 Diagnostic Results

```
1️⃣  Environment Variables
   ✅ Spreadsheet ID configured
   ✅ Service account email configured
   ✅ Private key configured and valid

2️⃣  OAuth Authentication
   ✅ JWT token created successfully
   ✅ Access token obtained successfully

3️⃣  Google Sheets API
   ❌ API NOT ENABLED (403 error)
   💡 Enable at: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/sheets.googleapis.com/overview?project=927667106833
```

## 📝 Summary

Everything is configured correctly in your code and environment. The **only** thing preventing logs from appearing is that the Google Sheets API needs to be enabled in your Google Cloud Console.

After enabling the API (takes 30 seconds), logging will work immediately!
