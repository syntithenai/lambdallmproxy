# Auto-Cast Snippets on View Feature

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE - Ready for Testing**

## Overview

When viewing a snippet in the SwagPage and Chromecast is already connected, the snippet will **automatically cast to the TV in full-screen** without needing to click the cast button. The sender device can then scroll through the snippet, with the TV mirroring the scroll position in real-time.

## What Changed

### File Modified: `ui-new/src/components/SwagPage.tsx`

**Added**: Auto-cast effect when viewing snippet with Chromecast connected

```typescript
// Auto-cast snippet to Chromecast when viewing if already connected
useEffect(() => {
  if (viewingSnippet && isCastConnected && !isCastingSnippet) {
    console.log('Auto-casting snippet to Chromecast:', viewingSnippet.title);
    castSnippet({
      id: viewingSnippet.id,
      content: viewingSnippet.content,
      title: viewingSnippet.title,
      tags: viewingSnippet.tags,
      created: new Date(viewingSnippet.timestamp),
      modified: viewingSnippet.updateDate ? new Date(viewingSnippet.updateDate) : new Date(viewingSnippet.timestamp)
    });
  }
}, [viewingSnippet, isCastConnected, isCastingSnippet, castSnippet]);
```

## How It Works

### User Flow

#### Before (Manual Cast Required)
1. User clicks "View" on a snippet
2. Snippet opens in view dialog
3. **User must click Cast button** to send to TV
4. Snippet appears on TV

#### After (Automatic Cast)
1. User connects to Chromecast (one-time setup)
2. User clicks "View" on any snippet
3. **Snippet automatically casts to TV** (full-screen)
4. User can scroll on phone/computer
5. TV mirrors scroll position in real-time

### Technical Flow

```
User clicks "View"
    ‚Üì
setViewingSnippet(snippet)
    ‚Üì
useEffect triggered
    ‚Üì
Check: viewingSnippet exists?
    ‚Üì YES
Check: isCastConnected?
    ‚Üì YES
Check: !isCastingSnippet? (not already casting)
    ‚Üì YES
Auto-call castSnippet()
    ‚Üì
Snippet appears full-screen on TV
    ‚Üì
User scrolls on sender device
    ‚Üì
sendSnippetScrollPosition() called
    ‚Üì
TV mirrors scroll position
```

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies
- **CastContext**: Provides `isCastConnected`, `isCastingSnippet`, `castSnippet()`
- **SwagContext**: Provides snippet data
- **React useEffect**: Triggers auto-cast on state change

### State Management
```typescript
// From CastContext
const { 
  isConnected: isCastConnected,     // Is Chromecast connected?
  castSnippet,                       // Function to cast snippet
  isCastingSnippet,                  // Is snippet currently casting?
  sendSnippetScrollPosition          // Sync scroll position
} = useCast();

// Component state
const [viewingSnippet, setViewingSnippet] = useState<ContentSnippet | null>(null);
```

### Auto-Cast Logic
```typescript
if (viewingSnippet && isCastConnected && !isCastingSnippet) {
  // Auto-cast when:
  // 1. A snippet is being viewed
  // 2. Chromecast is connected
  // 3. Not already casting a snippet (prevents duplicate casts)
  castSnippet(snippetData);
}
```

### Scroll Sync Logic
```typescript
onScroll={(e) => {
  if (isCastingSnippet && isCastConnected) {
    const target = e.currentTarget;
    const scrollPercentage = (target.scrollTop / (target.scrollHeight - target.clientHeight)) * 100;
    sendSnippetScrollPosition(scrollPercentage);
  }
}}
```

## User Experience

### Visual Feedback

**Sender Device (Phone/Computer):**
- View dialog shows snippet content
- Status indicator: "Casting to TV" (purple text with icon)
- Cast button available for manual control
- Scroll bar indicates position

**Receiver Device (TV):**
- Full-screen snippet display
- Markdown rendered beautifully
- Scrolls automatically when sender scrolls
- Title and metadata at top

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **No Chromecast Connected**
   - Snippet shows normally in view dialog
   - No auto-cast attempted
   - Cast button available to connect

2. **Already Casting Different Snippet**
   - Auto-cast skipped (prevents interruption)
   - User can manually cast new snippet

3. **Connection Lost During View**
   - Graceful fallback to local view
   - No errors or crashes

4. **Multiple Snippets Viewed**
   - Each new snippet auto-casts
   - Replaces previous snippet on TV

## Troubleshooting

### Snippet Doesn't Auto-Cast

**Check:**
1. Chromecast connected? (Look for connection icon)
2. Cast SDK loaded? (Check console)
3. Snippet opened? (View dialog visible)
4. Already casting? (Purple "Casting to TV" text)

**Solutions:**
- Refresh page to reload Cast SDK
- Disconnect and reconnect Chromecast
- Close and re-open snippet

### Scroll Not Syncing

**Check:**
1. Snippet actually cast? (Check TV)
2. Network stable? (Both devices online)
3. Scrolling on correct element? (In view dialog)

**Solutions:**
- Manually click cast button to re-cast
- Check network connection
- Close and re-view snippet

### Duplicate Casts

**Should Not Happen** - prevention in place:
```typescript
if (!isCastingSnippet) {
  // Only cast if not already casting
}
```

If occurs:
- Report bug with steps to reproduce
- Clear browser cache
- Restart Chromecast

## Console Messages
