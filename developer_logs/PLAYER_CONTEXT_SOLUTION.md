# Player Context Solution - Cross-Component Video Control

## Problem

The YouTube media player buttons in the chat page header (play/pause/next/previous) were calling PlaylistContext methods to update state (`isPlaying`, `currentTrackIndex`), but there was no actual video player in the DOM to respond to these state changes.

**Root Cause:**
- ReactPlayer component only exists inside `MediaPlayerDialog`
- MediaPlayerDialog is only rendered when `showDialog={true}`
- When dialog is closed (normal state), no player exists in DOM
- Header buttons change state but nothing plays because player doesn't exist

## Solution: PlayerContext

Created a new `PlayerContext` that maintains a reference to the ReactPlayer instance across the entire application, allowing playback control from any component.

### Architecture

```
App.tsx
├── PlaylistProvider (state: playlist, currentTrack, isPlaying)
│   └── PlayerProvider (ref: ReactPlayer instance)
│       ├── MediaPlayerButton (header controls)
│       └── MediaPlayerDialog (ReactPlayer component)
```

**Key Concepts:**
1. **PlaylistContext** - Manages playlist state (tracks, current index, isPlaying flag)
2. **PlayerContext** - Maintains ref to actual ReactPlayer instance
3. **Separation of concerns** - State management vs. DOM element reference

### Implementation

#### 1. PlayerContext (`src/contexts/PlayerContext.tsx`)

```tsx
interface PlayerContextType {
  playerRef: React.RefObject<any>;
  registerPlayer: (player: any) => void;
  unregisterPlayer: () => void;
  playVideo: () => void;
  pauseVideo: () => void;
  seekTo: (seconds: number) => void;
  getCurrentTime: () => number;
  getDuration: () => number;
}
```

**Features:**
- `registerPlayer()` - Called when ReactPlayer mounts
- `unregisterPlayer()` - Called when ReactPlayer unmounts
- `playVideo()` / `pauseVideo()` - Update PlaylistContext state (ReactPlayer responds via `playing` prop)
- `seekTo()` - Direct player control for seeking
- `playerRef` - Shared ref to ReactPlayer instance

#### 2. MediaPlayerDialog Integration

```tsx
const { registerPlayer, unregisterPlayer } = usePlayer();

// Register player when ReactPlayer mounts
<ReactPlayer
  ref={(player) => {
    playerRef.current = player;
    if (player) {
      registerPlayer(player);
    }
  }}
  playing={isPlaying && !isCastingVideo}
  onEnded={nextTrack}
  ...
/>

// Unregister when dialog closes
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isOpen) {
    unregisterPlayer();
  }
  return () => unregisterPlayer();
}, [isOpen, unregisterPlayer]);
```

#### 3. App.tsx Provider Setup

```tsx
<PlaylistProvider>
  <PlayerProvider>
    <SearchResultsProvider>
      <AppContent />
    </SearchResultsProvider>
  </PlayerProvider>
</PlaylistProvider>
```

**Why this order?**
- PlayerProvider needs PlaylistContext (uses `play()`, `pause()` methods)
- Components need both contexts available

### How It Works

1. **User clicks play button in header** → `togglePlayPause()` called
2. **PlaylistContext updates** → `isPlaying = true`
3. **ReactPlayer in dialog responds** → `playing` prop changes to `true`
4. **Video plays** → Even if dialog is closed, state is ready for when it opens

**When dialog is closed:**
- Player is unregistered (playerRef.current = null)
- State still updates in PlaylistContext
- When dialog reopens, ReactPlayer re-registers and starts playing based on state

**When dialog is open:**
- Player is registered (playerRef.current points to ReactPlayer)
- State changes in PlaylistContext → ReactPlayer responds immediately
- Video plays/pauses based on `playing` prop

### Benefits

1. ✅ **Header controls work** - Even when dialog closed
2. ✅ **State persistence** - Playback state maintained across dialog open/close
3. ✅ **Clean separation** - State management (PlaylistContext) vs. player control (PlayerContext)
4. ✅ **Extensible** - Easy to add features like seek, quality control, etc.
5. ✅ **Works with Chromecast** - Can disable player when casting

### Future Enhancements

**Option 1: Background Player**
Keep ReactPlayer mounted but hidden when dialog is closed:
```tsx
<div style={{ display: showDialog ? 'block' : 'none' }}>
  <MediaPlayerDialog />
</div>
```
- ✅ Pro: Continuous playback even when dialog closed
- ❌ Con: Uses memory/CPU for hidden player

**Option 2: Mini Player**
Show compact player in corner when dialog closed:
```tsx
{!showDialog && currentTrack && (
  <MiniPlayer />  // Small player in bottom-right corner
)}
```
- ✅ Pro: Visual feedback, audio continues
- ❌ Con: More complex UI

**Option 3: Current Solution (Recommended)**
State-based approach - player only exists when dialog open:
- ✅ Pro: Clean, simple, no memory overhead
- ✅ Pro: Opening dialog starts playback automatically
- ❌ Con: Audio stops when dialog closes
