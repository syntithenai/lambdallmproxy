# Playlist Toast Notifications Update

## Summary
Updated MediaPlayerDialog to use toast notifications for all playlist operations while keeping button labels concise.

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ Already Using Toasts
The save and load operations were already showing toast notifications:

**Save Playlist** (line 491):
```typescript
showSuccess(`Playlist "${playlistName}" saved successfully!`);
```

**Load Playlist** (line 542):
```typescript
showSuccess(`Playlist "${p.name}" loaded successfully!`);
```

### üîß New Toast Added

**Clear Playlist** (line 459):
- Added success toast after clearing: `showSuccess('Playlist cleared successfully!');`
- Kept confirmation dialog (for safety on destructive action)

**Delete Playlist** (line 553):
- Already had success toast, kept it as is
- Kept confirmation dialog (for safety on destructive action)

### üìè Button Labels

Buttons already have concise labels:
- **Save** - Opens save dialog
- **Load** - Opens load dialog  
- **Clear All** - Clears entire playlist

## User Experience Flow

1. **Save**: Click "Save" ‚Üí Enter name ‚Üí Shows toast "Playlist [name] saved successfully!"
2. **Load**: Click "Load" ‚Üí Select playlist ‚Üí Shows toast "Playlist [name] loaded successfully!"
3. **Clear**: Click "Clear All" ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Shows toast "Playlist cleared successfully!"
4. **Delete**: Click "Delete" in load dialog ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Shows toast "Playlist [name] deleted!"

## Error Handling

All operations show error toasts if they fail:
- `showError('Failed to save playlist: ' + error.message)`
- `showError('Failed to load playlist: ' + error.message)`
- `showError('Failed to delete playlist: ' + error.message)`

## Notes

- Kept `confirm()` dialogs for destructive operations (Clear, Delete) as a safety measure
- Toast notifications provide non-blocking feedback
- Button labels are concise and clear
- All toast messages use consistent format
