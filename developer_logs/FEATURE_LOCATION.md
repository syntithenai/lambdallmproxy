# Location Feature Implementation

## Overview

The location feature enables the application to request browser geolocation data and send it with chat requests to provide context-aware responses. This is particularly useful for location-specific queries about weather, local businesses, directions, and regional information.

## Implementation Date

- **Date**: January 12, 2025
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete and deployed

## Components

### 1. LocationContext (`ui-new/src/contexts/LocationContext.tsx`)

React context that manages browser geolocation state and reverse geocoding.

**Key Features**:
- Browser Geolocation API integration with high accuracy mode
- OpenStreetMap Nominatim API for reverse geocoding (coordinates ‚Üí address)
- Permission state management with change listener
- LocalStorage persistence with 24-hour expiry
- Comprehensive error handling

**API Configuration**:
- **Endpoint**: `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse`
- **User-Agent**: `'LLMProxyChat/1.0'` (required by Nominatim)
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds
- **Maximum Age**: 5 minutes
- **High Accuracy**: Enabled

**State Management**:
```typescript
{
  location: {
    latitude: number,
    longitude: number,
    accuracy: number,  // in meters
    address: {
      city?: string,
      state?: string,
      country?: string,
      postalCode?: string,
      formatted?: string
    },
    timestamp: number
  } | null,
  isLoading: boolean,
  error: string | null,
  permissionState: 'prompt' | 'granted' | 'denied' | 'unknown'
}
```

**Exported Functions**:
- `requestLocation()`: Gets coordinates via navigator.geolocation
- `reverseGeocode(lat, lon)`: Fetches address from Nominatim API
- `clearLocation()`: Removes location data from state and localStorage

**Error Handling**:
- Code 1: Permission denied by user
- Code 2: Location unavailable (no GPS/network)
- Code 3: Timeout (exceeded 10 seconds)

### 2. Location Settings Tab (`ui-new/src/components/SettingsModal.tsx`)

Location management interface integrated into the Settings dialog as a dedicated tab.

**Features**:
- **üìç Location Tab**: Fourth tab in Settings dialog (after Provider, Tools, Proxy)
- **Status Card**: Large visual card showing current location state
  - **Green**: Location enabled (shows address and coordinates)
  - **Red**: Permission denied (with instructions)
  - **Gray**: Not enabled (with enable button)
- **Location Details** (when enabled):
  - Formatted address or city/state/country
  - Precise coordinates (6 decimal places)
  - Accuracy in meters
  - Last updated timestamp
- **Action Buttons**:
  - **Enable Location**: Request browser permission (when not enabled)
  - **Refresh**: Update location to current position
  - **Clear**: Remove location data from browser
- **Privacy Notice**: Blue info panel with usage and privacy information

**Placement**:
- Settings Dialog ‚Üí Location Tab (üìç)
- Accessed via Settings button in header
- Full-width dedicated interface (not a small button)

### 3. ChatTab Integration (`ui-new/src/components/ChatTab.tsx`)

**Changes**:
- Imported `useLocation` hook from LocationContext
- Extracts location data using `const { location } = useLocation()`
- Includes location in both initial and continuation requests:

```typescript
if (location) {
  requestPayload.location = {
    latitude: location.latitude,
    longitude: location.longitude,
    accuracy: location.accuracy,
    address: location.address,
    timestamp: location.timestamp
  };
  console.log('üìç Including location in request:', 
    location.address?.city || `${location.latitude.toFixed(4)}, ${location.longitude.toFixed(4)}`);
}
```

### 4. Lambda System Prompt Injection (`src/endpoints/chat.js`)

**Changes**:
The Lambda handler now extracts location data from the request body and injects it as a system message at the beginning of the conversation.

**Injection Logic** (lines 585-632):
```javascript
if (location && location.latitude && location.longitude) {
  const locationInfo = [];
  locationInfo.push(`User's Current Location:`);
  locationInfo.push(`- Coordinates: ${location.latitude.toFixed(4)}, ${location.longitude.toFixed(4)} (¬±${location.accuracy?.toFixed(0) || '?'}m)`);
  
  if (location.address) {
    const addr = location.address;
    if (addr.formatted) {
      locationInfo.push(`- Address: ${addr.formatted}`);
    } else {
      const parts = [];
      if (addr.city) parts.push(addr.city);
      if (addr.state) parts.push(addr.state);
      if (addr.country) parts.push(addr.country);
      if (parts.length > 0) {
        locationInfo.push(`- Location: ${parts.join(', ')}`);
      }
    }
  }
  
  locationInfo.push('');
  locationInfo.push('Please use this location information when answering location-specific queries such as:');
  locationInfo.push('- Weather and climate information');
  locationInfo.push('- Local businesses, restaurants, and services');
  locationInfo.push('- Directions and navigation');
  locationInfo.push('- Area-specific recommendations');
  locationInfo.push('- Time zones and local time');
  locationInfo.push('- Regional news or events');
  
  const locationSystemMessage = {
    role: 'system',
    content: locationInfo.join('\n')
  };
  
  // Prepend location system message to existing messages
  messages = [locationSystemMessage, ...messages];
  
  console.log('üìç Location injected into system prompt:', 
    location.address?.city || `${location.latitude.toFixed(4)}, ${location.longitude.toFixed(4)}`);
}
```

**System Message Format**:
```
User's Current Location:
- Coordinates: 37.7749, -122.4194 (¬±25m)
- Address: San Francisco, California, United States

Please use this location information when answering location-specific queries such as:
- Weather and climate information
- Local businesses, restaurants, and services
- Directions and navigation
- Area-specific recommendations
- Time zones and local time
- Regional news or events
```

## User Workflow

1. **First Time Use**:
   - User clicks Settings button in header
   - Navigates to Location tab (üìç)
   - Clicks "Enable Location" button
   - Browser prompts for location permission
   - User grants permission
   - App fetches precise coordinates
   - Nominatim API reverse geocodes to address
   - Location data stored in localStorage (24-hour expiry)
   - Status card turns green showing address and details

2. **Subsequent Uses**:
   - Location automatically loaded from localStorage on page load
   - User can open Settings ‚Üí Location tab to view details
   - User can click "Refresh" to get updated coordinates
   - User can click "Clear" to remove location data

3. **Chat Integration**:
   - When location is available, it's automatically included in all chat requests
   - Lambda injects location into system prompt
   - LLM uses location context for relevant queries

## Privacy Considerations

1. **User Consent**:
   - Browser native permission prompt required
   - User must explicitly grant location access
   - Permission can be revoked anytime via browser settings

2. **Data Handling**:
   - Location stored locally in browser (localStorage)
   - Sent to Lambda only when user sends a chat message
   - Not stored permanently on server
   - Expires automatically after 24 hours

3. **Privacy Notice**:
   - Location button details panel includes notice:
     > "Your location helps provide context-aware responses for local queries (weather, restaurants, directions, etc.)"

4. **User Control**:
   - Clear button to remove location data
   - Can disable by denying browser permission
   - Works fine without location (optional feature)

## Use Cases

### Example Queries That Benefit From Location:

1. **Weather**: "What's the weather like today?"
2. **Local Businesses**: "Find pizza restaurants nearby"
3. **Directions**: "How do I get to the airport?"
4. **Time**: "What time is it?" (uses timezone)
5. **Events**: "What's happening this weekend?"
6. **Recommendations**: "Suggest hiking trails"
7. **News**: "Local news updates"

### Queries That Don't Need Location:

- General knowledge questions
- Code generation
- Math problems
- Historical facts
- Philosophical discussions

## Technical Details

### Geolocation API Options:
```javascript
{
  enableHighAccuracy: true,  // Use GPS if available
  timeout: 10000,            // 10 second timeout
  maximumAge: 300000         // Accept 5-minute-old cache
}
```

### Nominatim API Request:
```
GET https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse
  ?lat=37.7749
  &lon=-122.4194
  &format=json
  
Headers:
  User-Agent: LLMProxyChat/1.0
```

### LocalStorage Schema:
```javascript
{
  "chat_location": {
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194,
    "accuracy": 25,
    "address": {
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "California",
      "country": "United States",
      "postalCode": "94102",
      "formatted": "San Francisco, California, United States"
    },
    "timestamp": 1705075200000
  }
}
```

2. **Batching**: Batch multiple geocoding requests
3. **CDN**: Use geocoding CDN for faster responses
4. **Compression**: Compress location data in localStorage

## Known Issues

### Browser Compatibility:
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge: Full support
- ‚úÖ Firefox: Full support
- ‚úÖ Safari: Full support (requires HTTPS)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mobile Safari: May require user interaction first
- ‚ö†Ô∏è HTTP Sites: Geolocation API blocked (requires HTTPS)

### Nominatim API Limitations:
- **Rate Limit**: 1 request/second (we're well below this)
- **Usage Policy**: Must include User-Agent header ‚úÖ
- **Accuracy**: Varies by region (urban > rural)
- **Availability**: Free service, may have occasional downtime

### Edge Cases:
1. **No GPS**: Falls back to IP-based location (less accurate)
2. **Offline**: Geolocation fails, uses cached location if available
3. **VPN**: May show VPN server location instead of actual location
4. **Airplane Mode**: Fails gracefully with error message
