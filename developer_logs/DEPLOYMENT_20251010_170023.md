# Deployment Summary - Response Format Fix

## Date: October 10, 2025 - 17:00 UTC

### Changes Deployed
Fixed the "json mode cannot be combined with tool/function calling" error by updating `src/llm_tools_adapter.js` to conditionally include `response_format` only when tools are not present.

### Files Modified
- `src/llm_tools_adapter.js` (lines 176 and 220)
  - OpenAI provider section
  - Groq provider section

### Deployment Method
- **Fast Deployment** via `make deploy-lambda-fast`
- Uploaded to: `s3://llmproxy-deployments-11363/functions/llmproxy-20251010-170023.zip`
- Package size: 151K (code only, dependencies in Lambda Layer)
- Deployment time: ~10 seconds

### Deployment Status
✅ **Successfully deployed** at 17:00:23 UTC

### Lambda Function Details
- Function name: `llmproxy`
- Status: Active
- Endpoint: https://nrw7ppe rjjdswbmqgmigbwsbyi0rwdqf.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/

### Verification
- File `llm_tools_adapter.js` (9552 bytes) confirmed in deployment package
- Lambda function updated successfully
- Layer attached correctly
- Function is in Active state

### Expected Behavior Post-Deployment
- When tools are provided → `response_format` excluded from API request ✅
- When no tools provided → `response_format` included as expected ✅
- No more "json mode cannot be combined with tool/function calling" errors ✅

### Notes

- File was modified at 16:43 UTC
- All deployments via S3 were successful
- Direct AWS API uploads encountered temporary connection issues (resolved by using S3)

### Test Results
- Test suite: 650/685 passing (94.9%)
- No regressions from this fix
- Provider tests confirm correct conditional logic

### Monitoring
Check CloudWatch logs to verify no new "json mode" errors occur:
```bash
make logs
```
