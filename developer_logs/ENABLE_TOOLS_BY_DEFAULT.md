# Enable Code and Scrape Tools by Default - October 6, 2025

## Summary

Updated the default tool configuration to enable `execute_js` and `scrape_url` tools by default, along with the already-enabled `web_search` tool.

## Change Made

**File:** `ui-new/src/components/ChatTab.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
const [enabledTools, setEnabledTools] = useLocalStorage<{
  web_search: boolean;
  execute_js: boolean;
  scrape_url: boolean;
}>('chat_enabled_tools', {
  web_search: true,
  execute_js: false,  // ❌ Disabled
  scrape_url: false   // ❌ Disabled
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
const [enabledTools, setEnabledTools] = useLocalStorage<{
  web_search: boolean;
  execute_js: boolean;
  scrape_url: boolean;
}>('chat_enabled_tools', {
  web_search: true,
  execute_js: true,   // ✅ Enabled
  scrape_url: true    // ✅ Enabled
});
```

## Rationale

With all three tools enabled by default, the LLM will have access to:

1. **web_search** - Search the web and get current information
2. **execute_js** - Execute JavaScript code for calculations and data processing
3. **scrape_url** - Scrape and extract content from web pages

This provides a more powerful default experience where the LLM can:
- Search for information
- Process and calculate data
- Extract content from specific URLs
- Combine all three for comprehensive research tasks

## User Impact

### For New Users
- All three tools will be available immediately
- No need to manually enable tools in settings
- Better out-of-the-box experience

### For Existing Users
- Users who already have `chat_enabled_tools` in localStorage will keep their settings
- Only affects users who haven't customized tool settings yet
- Users can still disable tools individually in the chat interface

## Tool Capabilities

### 1. Web Search (`web_search`)
- Search DuckDuckGo for current information
- Get titles, URLs, and snippets
- Load full page content
- Generate LLM summaries

### 2. Execute JavaScript (`execute_js`)
- Run JavaScript code in a sandboxed environment
- Perform calculations and data processing
- Generate charts and visualizations
- Process JSON and data structures

### 3. Scrape URL (`scrape_url`)
- Extract content from specific web pages
- Parse HTML and get clean text
- Follow links and extract structured data
- Bypass paywalls (when content is accessible)

## Security Considerations

### Execute JS
- ⚠️ Runs code in Lambda environment
- ✅ Has timeout protection (30 seconds)
- ✅ Limited to JavaScript standard library
- ✅ No file system or network access from JS
- ⚠️ Could consume Lambda execution time

### Scrape URL
- ⚠️ Makes external HTTP requests
- ✅ Has timeout protection
- ✅ Sanitizes HTML content
- ⚠️ Could be rate limited by target sites
- ⚠️ Could consume bandwidth

**Recommendation:** These tools are safe for authenticated users. All requests require Google OAuth authentication and email whitelist verification.

## Build Results

**Status:** ✅ Build successful!

**Bundle hash:** `CTYisrsl` → `Dzs4F1vl`

## Testing Checklist

### New Users (Clear localStorage)
- [ ] Open app in incognito/clear localStorage
- [ ] Verify all three tool checkboxes are checked by default
- [ ] Send a query requiring web search → Should work
- [ ] Send a query requiring calculation → Should use execute_js
- [ ] Send a query requiring URL scraping → Should use scrape_url

### Existing Users (With localStorage)
- [ ] Open app with existing settings
- [ ] Verify existing tool preferences are preserved
- [ ] Manually toggle tools → Settings should persist

### Tool Functionality
- [ ] Test web search: "What are the latest AI developments?"
- [ ] Test execute_js: "Calculate fibonacci(10)"
- [ ] Test scrape_url: "Summarize the content at https://example.com"
- [ ] Test combined: "Search for Python tutorials and analyze the first result"

## Clearing localStorage to Test

Users can clear localStorage to get the new defaults:

**Method 1: Browser Console**
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('chat_enabled_tools');
location.reload();
```

**Method 2: Clear All Settings**
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

**Method 3: DevTools**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Expand Local Storage
4. Delete `chat_enabled_tools` key
5. Refresh page

## Tool Configuration UI

Users can still enable/disable tools individually in the chat interface:

```
☑ Web Search    - Search the web for current information
☑ Execute JS    - Run JavaScript code
☑ Scrape URL    - Extract content from web pages
```

All checkboxes are now checked by default for new users!

## Performance Considerations

### With All Tools Enabled
- LLM has more options → May make more tool calls
- More tool calls → Longer response times
- More tool calls → Higher Lambda execution time
- More tool calls → More API costs (Groq/OpenAI)

### Monitoring
- Watch CloudWatch metrics for Lambda execution time
- Monitor Groq API usage and rate limits
- Track tool execution frequency in logs

## Rollback

If needed, revert to previous defaults:

```typescript
const [enabledTools, setEnabledTools] = useLocalStorage(
  'chat_enabled_tools', 
  {
    web_search: true,
    execute_js: false,
    scrape_url: false
  }
);
```

Then rebuild and deploy.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Build completed
2. ⏳ Test with all tools enabled
3. ⏳ Monitor tool usage patterns
4. ⏳ Collect user feedback
5. ⏳ Consider adding tool usage analytics
