# ‚úÖ Google Sheets Logging - FULLY OPERATIONAL

## üéâ Status: WORKING!

All systems are operational. Google Sheets logging is now fully functional.

## ‚úÖ What Was Completed

### 1. Fixed Code Issues
- ‚úÖ Fixed `email is not defined` bug (changed to `userEmail`)
- ‚úÖ Added automatic sheet tab creation
- ‚úÖ Added error logging support (error code + message columns)
- ‚úÖ Deployed all fixes to Lambda

### 2. Configured Environment
- ‚úÖ Google Sheets API enabled
- ‚úÖ Sheet shared with service account
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured and deployed
- ‚úÖ Sheet tab "LLM Usage Log" created automatically
- ‚úÖ Headers initialized

### 3. Verified Working
- ‚úÖ OAuth authentication working
- ‚úÖ Sheet access confirmed
- ‚úÖ Test row written successfully
- ‚úÖ All diagnostic checks passed

## üìä Your Google Sheet

**View your logs here:**
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i0wNrPjMh21-1TIsAUZbYwV_c30A4-g39m4rJ-zr9Fw/edit

**Sheet structure:**
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Timestamp | ISO 8601 timestamp |
| User Email | Authenticated user's email |
| Provider | LLM provider (gemini-free, openai, etc.) |
| Model | Model name (gemini-2.0-flash, gpt-4o, etc.) |
| Tokens In | Input/prompt tokens |
| Tokens Out | Output/completion tokens |
| Total Tokens | Sum of in + out |
| Cost ($) | Calculated cost (per model pricing) |
| Duration (s) | Request duration in seconds |
| Error Code | Error code if request failed |
| Error Message | Error details if request failed |

## üß™ Test It

Make a chat request through your UI and you'll see a new row appear in the sheet!

**Check logs:**
```bash
make logs
```

Look for:
```
‚úÖ Logged to Google Sheets: gemini-2.0-flash (719 tokens, $0.0000)
```

## üìä What Gets Logged

### Successful Requests
Every successful LLM API request will log:
- Who made the request (email)
- Which provider/model was used
- How many tokens were consumed
- How much it cost (calculated from pricing table)
- How long it took

### Failed Requests
Every error will also be logged with:
- All the above fields (with 0 tokens if no response)
- Error code (e.g., "MAX_ITERATIONS", "ERROR", "UNAUTHORIZED")
- Error message with details

### Example Logs

**Success:**
```
2025-10-11T16:30:00Z | user@example.com | gemini-free | gemini-2.0-flash | 150 | 500 | 650 | $0.0000 | 2.35 | | |
```

**Error:**
```
2025-10-11T16:31:00Z | user@example.com | gemini-free | gemini-2.0-flash | 0 | 0 | 0 | $0.0000 | 1.12 | ERROR | Connection timeout |
```

## üîß How It Works

### Non-Blocking Design
- Logging happens asynchronously
- If logging fails, your requests still succeed
- Errors are logged to CloudWatch but don't affect users

### Auto-Recovery
- Automatically creates sheet tab if missing
- Handles API rate limits gracefully
- Continues even if spreadsheet is temporarily unavailable

### Security
- Uses Service Account (no user passwords)
- OAuth2 JWT authentication
- Private key stored in Lambda environment variables
- Never exposed to users

## üí∞ Cost Tracking

The system tracks costs using these rates:

**Gemini (Free Tier):** $0.00 per 1M tokens
**OpenAI:**
- gpt-4o: $2.50 input / $10.00 output per 1M tokens
- gpt-4o-mini: $0.15 input / $0.60 output per 1M tokens

**Groq (Free Tier):** $0.00 per 1M tokens

Update pricing in `src/services/google-sheets-logger.js` if rates change.

## üìà Analytics

Your sheet is now a powerful analytics database. You can:

1. **Track usage by user**
   ```
   =QUERY(A:K, "SELECT B, SUM(G) WHERE B <> 'User Email' GROUP BY B")
   ```

2. **Track costs by model**
   ```
   =QUERY(A:K, "SELECT D, SUM(H) WHERE D <> 'Model' GROUP BY D")
   ```

3. **Track error rates**
   ```
   =COUNTIF(J:J, "<>") / COUNTA(A:A)
   ```

4. **Average request duration**
   ```
   =AVERAGE(I2:I)
   ```

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Update Pricing
Edit `src/services/google-sheets-logger.js`:
```javascript
const PRICING = {
    'your-model': { input: X.XX, output: Y.YY }
};
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
make deploy-lambda-fast
```

### Change Sheet Name
Update `.env`:
```bash
GOOGLE_SHEETS_LOG_SHEET_NAME=My Custom Name
```

Deploy:
```bash
make deploy-env
```

### Disable Logging
Remove or comment out these variables in `.env`:
```bash
# GOOGLE_SHEETS_LOG_SPREADSHEET_ID=...
# GOOGLE_SHEETS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=...
# GOOGLE_SHEETS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=...
```

Deploy:
```bash
make deploy-env
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Make some test requests through your UI
2. ‚úÖ Check your Google Sheet for logs
3. ‚úÖ Set up any custom analytics/charts you want
4. ‚úÖ Monitor costs and usage patterns

## üêõ Troubleshooting

If logs stop appearing:

1. Check CloudWatch: `make logs`
2. Look for Google Sheets errors
3. Run diagnostic: `node test-sheets-diagnostic.js`
4. See: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
