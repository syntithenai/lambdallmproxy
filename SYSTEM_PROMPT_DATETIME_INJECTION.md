# System Prompt Date/Time Injection

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Issue**: Instead of encouraging the LLM to use execute_javascript to get the current date/time, inject it directly into the system prompt.

## Problem Statement

Previously, the system prompt included extensive guidance telling the LLM to use the `execute_javascript` tool whenever it needed the current date or time. This approach:
1. Required an extra tool call for simple date/time queries
2. Added unnecessary complexity and latency
3. Consumed additional tokens
4. Could fail if the tool execution had issues

## Solution

**Direct Injection**: Inject the current date and time directly into the system prompt at request time, making it immediately available to the LLM without any tool calls.

### Implementation

#### 1. Created Date/Time Helper Function (src/config/prompts.js)

```javascript
// Helper function to get current date/time string
function getCurrentDateTime() {
    const now = new Date();
    const dateStr = now.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { 
        weekday: 'long', 
        year: 'numeric', 
        month: 'long', 
        day: 'numeric' 
    });
    const timeStr = now.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', { 
        hour: '2-digit', 
        minute: '2-digit', 
        second: '2-digit',
        timeZoneName: 'short'
    });
    const isoStr = now.toISOString();
    return `${dateStr}, ${timeStr} (ISO: ${isoStr})`;
}
```

**Output Format**:
```
Wednesday, October 9, 2024, 01:28:36 PM EDT (ISO: 2024-10-09T17:28:36.123Z)
```

#### 2. Modified System Prompt Generator (src/config/prompts.js)

Changed from a static constant to a function that generates the prompt with fresh date/time:

```javascript
// Comprehensive system prompt that encourages tool usage and DETAILED, VERBOSE responses
// This is a function that returns the prompt with current date/time injected
function getComprehensiveResearchSystemPrompt() {
    const currentDateTime = getCurrentDateTime();
    
    return process.env.SYSTEM_PROMPT_SEARCH || `You are a highly knowledgeable AI assistant with access to powerful research and computational tools. You excel at providing comprehensive, thorough, and detailed responses that fully address the user's questions.

**CURRENT DATE AND TIME:**
${currentDateTime}

You have access to the current date and time above. Use this information when responding to temporal queries about "today", "current date", "what time is it", etc. You do not need to use tools to get the current date/time as it is provided in this system prompt.
...
```

#### 3. Updated Temporal Guidance

**Before** (encouraging tool use):
```
**TEMPORAL INFORMATION - CRITICAL:**
- **You do NOT have access to the current date, time, or any real-time temporal information**
- Your training data has a knowledge cutoff date - you cannot know "today's date" or "current time" without using tools
- When the user asks about "today", "current date", "what time is it", "this week", "this month", "this year", or any temporal query requiring current date/time, you MUST use the execute_javascript tool
- **NEVER guess, estimate, or hallucinate dates** - always use JavaScript to get accurate current date/time
- **NEVER say "I don't have access to current date/time" without attempting to use execute_javascript first**
- Examples of when to use execute_javascript for date/time:
  * User asks: "What's today's date?" → Use execute_javascript
  * User asks: "What time is it?" → Use execute_javascript  
  * User asks: "How many days until Christmas?" → Use execute_javascript to get current date, then calculate
...
```

**After** (using injected date/time):
```
**TEMPORAL INFORMATION - IMPORTANT:**
- The current date and time are provided at the top of this system prompt
- Use this information when responding to queries about "today", "current date", "what time is it", etc.
- For date/time calculations (e.g., "days until Christmas", "age calculation"), you may use the execute_javascript tool
- **NEVER guess or hallucinate dates** - refer to the provided current date/time at the top of this prompt
- The execute_javascript tool captures ALL console.log outputs for date calculations and formatting
```

#### 4. Updated Lambda Handler (src/lambda_search_llm_handler.js)

Changed imports and usage to call the function instead of using a constant:

**Before**:
```javascript
const { MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS, DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT, COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT } = require('./config/prompts');

// Later in code...
systemPrompt: COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
```

**After**:
```javascript
const { MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS, DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT, getComprehensiveResearchSystemPrompt } = require('./config/prompts');

// Later in code...
systemPrompt: getComprehensiveResearchSystemPrompt(), // Get fresh prompt with current date/time
```

**Key Change**: The function is called at request time (not module load time) to ensure the date/time is always current.

#### 5. Module Exports (src/config/prompts.js)

**Before**:
```javascript
module.exports = {
    MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS,
    DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT,
    COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT
};
```

**After**:
```javascript
module.exports = {
    MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS,
    DEFAULT_REASONING_EFFORT,
    getComprehensiveResearchSystemPrompt
};
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Reduced Latency**
- **Before**: User asks "What's today's date?" → LLM decides to use execute_javascript → Tool executes → LLM receives result → LLM responds (~2-3 seconds)
- **After**: User asks "What's today's date?" → LLM reads from system prompt → LLM responds immediately (~0.5 seconds)

### 2. **Reduced Token Usage**
- **Before**: Tool call adds tokens for:
  - Function call parameters: ~20 tokens
  - JavaScript code: ~50 tokens
  - Tool result: ~30 tokens
  - Total: ~100 extra tokens per date/time query
- **After**: Date/time in system prompt: ~40 tokens (one-time, shared across all queries in the session)

### 3. **Improved Reliability**
- No dependency on tool execution infrastructure
- No risk of tool failures or timeouts
- Consistent behavior across all queries

### 4. **Simpler Mental Model**
- LLM doesn't need to "decide" to use a tool for basic date/time
- More natural and straightforward responses
- Reduces cognitive load on the LLM

### 5. **Better User Experience**
- Instant responses to date/time queries
- No unexpected tool execution for simple questions
- More predictable behavior

## Use Cases

### Simple Date/Time Queries
**User**: "What's today's date?"  
**Response**: "Today is Wednesday, October 9, 2024."

**User**: "What time is it?"  
**Response**: "It's currently 1:28 PM EDT (5:28 PM UTC)."

### Calculations Still Use Tools
**User**: "How many days until Christmas?"  
**Response**: Uses the injected current date (October 9, 2024) and can optionally use execute_javascript for precise calculation if needed.

### Temporal Context in Queries
**User**: "What are the top tech news stories today?"  
**LLM knows**: Today is October 9, 2024 → Uses search_web with "tech news October 9 2024"

## Technical Details

### Date/Time Format
The injected date/time includes:
1. **Human-readable**: "Wednesday, October 9, 2024, 01:28:36 PM EDT"
2. **ISO 8601**: "2024-10-09T17:28:36.123Z" (for calculations and standardization)

### Timezone
- Uses the server's local timezone (EDT/EST for US East Coast)
- Provides both local time and UTC (via ISO format)
- Includes timezone abbreviation for clarity

### Freshness
- Generated at request time (when `getComprehensiveResearchSystemPrompt()` is called)
- Each Lambda invocation gets a fresh timestamp
- Long-running requests will have the timestamp from when they started (acceptable for most use cases)

### Environment Variable Override
The system still respects `SYSTEM_PROMPT_SEARCH` environment variable:
```javascript
return process.env.SYSTEM_PROMPT_SEARCH || `You are a highly knowledgeable AI assistant...`;
```

If `SYSTEM_PROMPT_SEARCH` is set, the date/time injection doesn't happen (uses custom prompt as-is).

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Simple date query: "What's today's date?"
- [ ] Simple time query: "What time is it?"
- [ ] Temporal context: "What happened today in history?"
- [ ] Date calculations: "How many days until New Year?"
- [ ] Age calculations: "How old is someone born on March 15, 1990?"
- [ ] Time-based searches: "Latest news today"
- [ ] No unnecessary tool calls for simple date/time queries
- [ ] Tool calls still work when needed for calculations
- [ ] Multiple requests get fresh timestamps

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ No breaking changes for users
- ✅ Existing queries work the same or better
- ✅ Tool calls still available for complex calculations
- ✅ Custom system prompts (via env var) still work

### Performance Impact
- ✅ Negligible performance overhead (Date constructor is fast)
- ✅ Reduced latency for date/time queries
- ✅ Reduced token usage overall

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Timezone Detection**: Could detect user's timezone from request headers (if available)
2. **Localization**: Could format date/time based on user's locale
3. **Extended Context**: Could include day of week, week number, quarter, etc.
4. **Holiday Awareness**: Could note if today is a significant holiday
5. **Caching**: Could cache the prompt string for ~1 minute to reduce Date() calls (marginal benefit)

### Not Recommended
- ❌ **Don't remove execute_javascript entirely**: Still useful for complex date calculations
- ❌ **Don't update on every token**: Current request-time generation is the right balance
- ❌ **Don't add too much temporal context**: Keep it simple and focused

## Conclusion

This change simplifies the architecture by providing temporal context directly in the system prompt rather than requiring tool calls. It improves latency, reduces token usage, and provides a better user experience for date/time-related queries while maintaining the ability to use tools for more complex temporal calculations.
