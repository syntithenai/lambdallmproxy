## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **YouTube Embed Restrictions**
   - Some videos can't be embedded (copyright)
   - No programmatic control over playback (pause/seek)
   - **Mitigation**: Consider YouTube IFrame API upgrade

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - IndexedDB not available in private/incognito in some browsers
   - **Mitigation**: Falls back to localStorage

3. **Performance**
   - Recommend max 500 videos per playlist
   - Large playlists may need virtual scrolling
   - **Mitigation**: Future optimization with React.memo

### Not Implemented (Optional)
- Play buttons in YouTube search results
- Chromecast video casting
- Shuffle/repeat modes
- Playlist search/filter
- Video quality control
- Mini player mode
- Playback speed control
