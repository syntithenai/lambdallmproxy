## Technical Details

### Date Grouping Logic

Videos are grouped by date added:
- **Today**: Videos added today
- **Yesterday**: Videos added yesterday
- **This Week**: Videos added in the last 7 days
- **Specific dates**: Older videos show "Month Day" or "Month Day, Year"

Implementation in `groupByDate()` function:
```typescript
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

const yesterday = new Date(today);
yesterday.setDate(yesterday.getDate() - 1);

const weekAgo = new Date(today);
weekAgo.setDate(weekAgo.getDate() - 7);

// Compare trackDate with today/yesterday/weekAgo
```

### YouTube Player Integration

Using simple iframe embed:
```typescript
<iframe
  src={`https://www.youtube.com/embed/${currentTrack.videoId}?${isPlaying ? 'autoplay=1&' : ''}rel=0&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1`}
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
/>
```

**Pros**: Simple, reliable, no API key needed  
**Cons**: Limited control, YouTube branding  
**Future**: Could upgrade to YouTube IFrame API for more control

### IndexedDB Schema

**Database**: `youtube-playlist-db` (version 1)

**Object Stores**:

1. **`currentPlaylist`** (keyPath: 'id')
   ```typescript
   {
     id: 'current',
     tracks: PlaylistTrack[],
     currentIndex: number | null,
     isPlaying: boolean,
     updatedAt: number
   }
   ```

2. **`savedPlaylists`** (keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true)
   ```typescript
   {
     id: number,
     name: string,
     tracks: PlaylistTrack[],
     createdAt: number,
     updatedAt: number
   }
   ```
   Indexes: `by-name`, `by-date`

### Prepend Tracks Logic

When adding tracks to the start, adjust current track index:
```typescript
addTracksToStart = (tracks) => {
  const newTracks = [...]; // Create track objects
  setPlaylist(prev => [...newTracks, ...prev]);
  
  // Adjust current index (prepending shifts indices)
  if (currentTrackIndex !== null) {
    setCurrentTrackIndex(currentTrackIndex + newTracks.length);
  }
};
```

This ensures the currently playing track continues without interruption.

2. **Playing Videos**
   - Click MediaPlayerButton in header (only visible when playlist has items)
   - Opens MediaPlayerDialog with video player
   - Click any video in playlist to play it
   - Use prev/next buttons in header for quick navigation

3. **Managing Playlist**
   - Delete individual videos with confirmation
   - Clear entire playlist with confirmation
   - Videos grouped by date added

4. **Saving/Loading Playlists**

   - Enter a name for your playlist
   - Saved playlists persist in browser's IndexedDB
   - Click "üìÇ Load Playlist" to see and load saved playlists
   - Delete saved playlists from load dialog

### For Developers

#### Adding Tracks
```typescript
const { addTracks, addTracksToStart } = usePlaylist();

// Add to end
addTracks([
  { videoId: 'abc123', url: 'https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123', title: 'Video 1', ... }
]);

// Add to start (for search results)
addTracksToStart([...tracks]);
```

#### Playing Specific Video
```typescript
const { playTrackByVideoId } = usePlaylist();

// Returns true if found and played, false otherwise
const success = playTrackByVideoId('abc123');
```

#### Managing Named Playlists
```typescript
const { 
  savedPlaylists, 
  savePlaylistAs, 
  loadPlaylist, 
  deletePlaylist,
  refreshSavedPlaylists 
} = usePlaylist();

// Save current playlist
await savePlaylistAs('My Favorites');

// Load saved playlist
await loadPlaylist(playlistId);

// Delete saved playlist

## Known Issues

1. ~~**Pre-existing TypeScript Errors**~~ ‚úÖ **FIXED**
   - ~~`ChatTab.tsx`: `Type 'Timeout' is not assignable to type 'number'` (line 1384)~~
   - ~~`TagAutocomplete.tsx`: RefObject type mismatch (line 36)~~
   - ~~`VoiceInputDialog.tsx`: `Type 'Timeout' is not assignable to type 'number'` (line 136)~~
   - **Fixed**: Changed timeout types to `ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>` and RefObject to accept `T | null`
   - **Status**: Build now completes successfully ‚úÖ

2. **YouTube Embed Limitations**
   - Some videos may not be embeddable (copyright restrictions)
   - No programmatic control over playback (pause/seek from code)
   - **Mitigation**: Consider upgrading to YouTube IFrame API in Phase 6

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - IndexedDB not available in private/incognito mode in some browsers
   - **Mitigation**: Falls back to localStorage, then shows error

   - Sync play/pause state
   - Switch between chat and video modes

3. **Phase 7: Polish**

   - Better error messages
   - Performance optimization
   - Accessibility improvements

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have)

1. **Shuffle & Repeat Modes**
   - Shuffle playlist order
   - Repeat one/repeat all

2. **Playlist Search/Filter**
   - Search within playlist by title/channel
   - Filter by duration

3. **Video Quality Control**
   - Select video quality (720p, 1080p)
   - Auto-quality based on bandwidth

4. **Mini Player Mode**
   - Picture-in-picture support
   - Floating player widget

5. **Playlist Sharing**

---

## Performance Notes

### Memory Usage

- **Playlist limit**: Recommend max 500 videos per playlist
- **IndexedDB size**: ~50KB per 100 videos (with metadata)
- **Browser limit**: ~50MB typical IndexedDB quota

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Virtual scrolling**: Implement for playlists > 100 items
2. **Lazy loading**: Load thumbnails only when visible
3. **Debounce saves**: Batch IndexedDB writes
4. **Memoization**: Use React.memo for playlist items
5. **Web Workers**: Move IndexedDB operations to worker thread

---

## Dependencies

### Added

- **`idb` (v8.0.0)**: IndexedDB wrapper
  - License: ISC
  - Size: ~8KB gzipped
  - TypeScript support: ‚úÖ
  - Browser support: All modern browsers

### Existing (Used)

- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- Context API (PlaylistContext, AuthContext)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Custom hooks (useDialogClose)

---

## Migration Guide

### From Old PlaylistDialog to MediaPlayerDialog

The new MediaPlayerDialog is backward compatible with the old PlaylistDialog:

```typescript
// Old code (still works)
import { PlaylistDialog } from './components/PlaylistDialog';

// New code (recommended)
import { MediaPlayerDialog } from './components/MediaPlayerDialog';
```

Both imports work due to export alias:
```typescript
export const PlaylistDialog = MediaPlayerDialog;
```

### From localStorage to IndexedDB

Migration happens automatically on first load:
1. Checks for `youtube_playlist` in localStorage
2. If found, migrates to IndexedDB `currentPlaylist` store
3. Keeps localStorage data for one version (backup)
4. Future versions will remove localStorage fallback

To force migration:
```typescript
import { playlistDB } from '../utils/playlistDB';

// Clear IndexedDB (forces re-migration)
await playlistDB.clearCurrentPlaylist();
```
