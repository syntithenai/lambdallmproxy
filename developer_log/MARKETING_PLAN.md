# Marketing Plan - Lambda LLM Proxy
## AI Research Agent with Deep Knowledge Integration

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: READY FOR EXECUTION

---

## Executive Summary

Lambda LLM Proxy is a **comprehensive AI research assistant** that combines web scraping, agentic workflows, and knowledge management to deliver quality, referenced, fact-checked answers. Unlike simple chatbots, it's designed for researchers, writers, and knowledge workers who need to build large structured documents with confidence.

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Multi-tiered web scraping** (including Puppeteer for JavaScript-heavy sites)
- **Agentic tool-calling** (AI decides when/how to search, scrape, execute code)
- **Personal & team knowledge bases** (browser RAG + server RAG)
- **Document building workflows** (planning, snippets, todos)
- **Transparent pricing** (user pays LLM costs + 25% margin, OR brings own keys)
- **Privacy-first** (Google Drive sync, local storage, user-controlled data)

**Target Market**: Knowledge workers, researchers, technical writers, developers, small teams ($50B+ market)

**Go-to-Market Strategy**: Freemium SaaS with open-source foundation
