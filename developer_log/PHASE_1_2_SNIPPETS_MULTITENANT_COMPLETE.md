# Phase 1.2: Snippets Multi-Tenancy - COMPLETE ✅

**Completion Date**: January 30, 2025  
**Commit**: 22e9add

## Overview

Successfully implemented complete multi-tenancy for the snippets service. All CRUD operations now enforce row-level security using `user_email` and `project_id` columns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Update
- **Old Schema**: `A:H` (8 columns)
  - ID, Created At, Updated At, Title, Content, Tags, Source, URL
- **New Schema**: `A:J` (10 columns)
  - ID, User Email, Project ID, Created At, Updated At, Title, Content, Tags, Source, URL

### 2. Service Functions Updated

All functions in `src/services/google-sheets-snippets.js`:

#### ✅ insertSnippet(params, userEmail, projectId, accessToken)
- Adds `user_email` and `project_id` on create
- Validates user with `validateUserEmail()`
- Logs access with `logUserAccess()`

#### ✅ updateSnippet(id, updates, userEmail, projectId, accessToken)
- Filters by user/project with `filterByUserAndProject()`
- Verifies ownership before update
- Preserves original user_email/project_id
- Logs access

#### ✅ removeSnippet({id, title}, userEmail, projectId, accessToken)
- Filters by user/project before deletion
- Verifies access before delete
- Logs access

#### ✅ getSnippet({id, title}, userEmail, projectId, accessToken)
- Filters results by user/project
- Returns snippet with user_email/project_id fields
- Logs access

#### ✅ searchSnippets({query, tags}, userEmail, projectId, accessToken)
- Filters all search results by user/project
- Returns results with user_email/project_id fields
- Logs access with query details

### 3. Tools Integration

Updated `src/tools.js` manage_snippets tool:
- Added `extractProjectId` import at case block level
- All snippet actions now extract and pass projectId:
  - `insert` action
  - `capture` action
  - `get` action
  - `search` action
  - `delete` action

### 4. Security Features

Every snippet operation now:
1. **Validates User**: Calls `validateUserEmail(userEmail)` - throws if invalid
2. **Filters Data**: Uses `filterByUserAndProject(rows, userEmail, projectId)` for access control
3. **Logs Access**: Calls `logUserAccess(action, 'snippet', id, userEmail, projectId)` for audit trail
4. **Verifies Ownership**: Before updates/deletes, ensures user owns the resource

### 5. Dependencies

Uses utilities from `src/services/user-isolation.js`:
- `validateUserEmail()` - Authentication check
- `extractProjectId()` - Gets X-Project-ID from headers
- `filterByUserAndProject()` - Row-level filtering
- `logUserAccess()` - Audit logging

## Testing Recommendations

### Basic Functionality
1. **Create Snippet** (User A, Project X)
   - Create snippet with title "Test A1"
   - Verify user_email = User A
   - Verify project_id = Project X

2. **User Isolation** (User B, Project X)
   - Try to get snippet "Test A1"
   - Should return null (not found)
   - Create own snippet "Test B1"
   - Should succeed with user_email = User B

3. **Project Isolation** (User A, Project Y)
   - Try to get snippet "Test A1" (from Project X)
   - Should return null (different project)
   - Create snippet "Test A2" in Project Y
   - Should succeed

4. **Search Filtering**
   - User A searches in Project X → sees only Project X snippets
   - User A searches in Project Y → sees only Project Y snippets
   - User B searches → sees only their own snippets

5. **Update/Delete Protection**
   - User B tries to update User A's snippet → should fail
   - User A tries to delete snippet in different project → should fail
   - User A updates own snippet in same project → should succeed

### Edge Cases
- Search with no results
- Get with invalid ID
- Delete non-existent snippet
- Multiple users, same project (collaboration scenario)
- Same user, multiple projects (workspace switching)

## Migration Notes

**IMPORTANT**: Existing snippets in production need migration:
1. Read all existing snippets (old A:H schema)
2. For each row, add user_email (from owner) and project_id (default or inferred)
3. Write back as A:J schema
4. Verify all snippets accessible after migration

Migration script needed: `scripts/migrate-snippets-schema.js`

## Performance Considerations

- **Filter Overhead**: Every operation filters entire sheet by user/project
- **Optimization Opportunity**: Use Google Sheets query filters or caching for large datasets
- **Current Approach**: Fine for <1000 snippets per user, may need optimization beyond that

## Next Steps

Phase 1.2 is complete. Ready to move to:
- **Phase 3**: Quiz service multi-tenancy
- **Phase 4**: RAG/Embeddings isolation
