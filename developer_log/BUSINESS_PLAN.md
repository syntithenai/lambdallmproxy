## 1. Problem & Market Opportunity

### 1.1 The Problem

**Knowledge workers face three critical pain points with existing AI assistants:**

#### Pain Point 1: Cost Unpredictability
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/mo "unlimited" (but throttles heavy users, no cost breakdown)
- Perplexity Pro: $20/mo (300 queries cap, then degraded to free tier)
- Claude Pro: $20/mo (same throttling issues)
- **User quote**: *"I spent $60 last month across 3 AI tools and have no idea what I actually used."*

#### Pain Point 2: Citation Unreliability
- Hallucinated sources (30-40% of citations in GPT-4 research tasks)
- No way to verify scraping quality
- "Black box" summarization
- **User quote**: *"I can't trust AI research for academic work - too many fake citations."*

#### Pain Point 3: Vendor Lock-in
- API keys controlled by vendor
- No data portability
- Forced upgrades to access features
- **User quote**: *"I want to use my own OpenAI credits, not pay ChatGPT's markup."*

### 1.2 Market Size

### 3.2 Pricing Model

**Pay-Per-Use with 25% Margin**:

```
User Cost = (LLM Provider Cost) × 1.25
```

**Example**: GPT-4o query (50K input, 10K output)
- Provider cost: $0.125 + $0.100 = $0.225
- User pays: $0.225 × 1.25 = **$0.281**
- Our profit: **$0.056** (25% gross margin)

**If user brings own API key**:
- Provider cost: Paid by user directly
- User pays Research Agent: **$0**
- Our profit: **$0** (strategic loss for virality)

**Why 25% margin?**
1. **Transparent**: Clearly stated, no hidden markup
2. **Fair**: Lower than ChatGPT Plus ($20 unlimited = 200-500% effective markup)
3. **Sustainable**: Covers infrastructure, support, development
4. **Competitive**: Allows discounts/promotions without going negative

### 3.3 Unit Economics

**LTV:CAC Ratio**: 4.8x (healthy, target is >3x)

**Gross Margin**: 35-40%
- LLM costs: 50% of revenue (avg user uses 80% of included credits)
- AWS Lambda: 1% of revenue
- PayPal fees: 4% of revenue
- Support: 5% of revenue (allocated)
- **Gross profit**: 40%

**Payback Period**: 2.5 months

## 9. Exit Strategy

### 9.1 Potential Acquirers

**Tier 1: Strategic ($100M-$500M range)**
1. **Microsoft** (GitHub integration, Copilot synergy)
2. **Google** (Workspace AI, Gemini ecosystem)
3. **OpenAI** (Research product, expand use cases)

**Tier 2: Mid-Market ($20M-$100M range)**
1. **Notion** (AI workspace, research workflows)
2. **Atlassian** (Confluence AI, documentation)
3. **Grammarly** (Expand beyond writing to research)

**Tier 3: Consolidation ($5M-$20M range)**
1. **Perplexity** (Consolidate research AI market)
2. **Jasper** (Add research to content suite)
3. **Copy.ai** (Expand TAM beyond marketing)

### 9.2 Valuation Scenarios

**SaaS Valuation Multiples** (2025 market):
- Early-stage (<$1M ARR): 3-5x revenue
- Growth-stage ($1M-10M ARR): 5-10x revenue
- Late-stage (>$10M ARR): 10-20x revenue
- AI category premium: +50% multiple

| ARR | Stage | Multiple | Valuation | Founder Take (100% ownership) |
|-----|-------|----------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| $1M | Year 1 | 5x | $5M | $5M |
| $5M | Year 2.5 | 8x | $40M | $40M |
| $10M | Year 3 | 12x | $120M | $120M |
| $20M | Year 4 | 15x | $300M | $300M |

**With Dilution** (20% after seed round):
- $10M ARR: $120M × 80% = **$96M** founder take
- $20M ARR: $300M × 80% = **$240M** founder take

### 9.3 Timeline to Exit

**Realistic Timeline**: 4-6 years to acquisition
- Year 1: Build to $1M ARR (prove model)
- Year 2: Scale to $5M ARR (prove GTM)
- Year 3: Reach $10M ARR (attractive to acquirers)
- Year 4: Hit $20M ARR (strategic acquisition range)
- Year 5-6: $50M+ ARR (IPO or major acquisition)

**Triggers for Acquisition Discussions**:
1. **$5M ARR**: Mid-market acquirers start circling
2. **$10M ARR**: Strategic acquirers express interest
3. **Market consolidation**: Perplexity/Jasper acquisition spree
4. **Competitive threat**: ChatGPT launches competing feature
