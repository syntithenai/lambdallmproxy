# Fix: Makefile Test Target Missing

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… FIXED  
**Issue**: `make test` command failed with "whisper-rocm/test-api.sh: No such file or directory"

---

## Problem

When running `make test` from the project root, the command failed with:

```
chmod: cannot access 'whisper-rocm/test-api.sh': No such file or directory
make: *** [Makefile:58: test] Error 1
```

### Root Cause

The main Makefile **did not have a `test` target defined**. When running `make test`, Make was finding and executing the `test` target from `whisper-rocm/Makefile` instead, which referenced a script file that doesn't exist (`whisper-rocm/test-api.sh`).

**whisper-rocm/Makefile** (lines 57-59):
```makefile
test: ## Test the API endpoints
	@chmod +x whisper-rocm/test-api.sh
	@./whisper-rocm/test-api.sh
```

This path would only work when running from inside the `whisper-rocm/` directory, not from the project root.

---

## Solution

Added proper `test` targets to the main Makefile that run the project's Jest test suite.

### Changes Made

**File**: `Makefile`

#### 1. Updated `.PHONY` Declaration
Added `test`, `test-watch`, and `test-coverage` to the list of phony targets:

```makefile
.PHONY: ... test test-watch test-coverage ...
```

#### 2. Added Help Text
Added new "Testing" section to the help output (after line 80):

```makefile
@echo ""
@echo "Testing:"
@echo "  make test                - Run Jest test suite"
@echo "  make test-watch          - Run Jest in watch mode"
@echo "  make test-coverage       - Run tests with coverage report"
@echo ""
```

#### 3. Added Test Targets
Added three new targets before the "Docker Commands" section (around line 370):

```makefile
# ================================================================
# Testing
# ================================================================

# Run Jest test suite
test:
	@echo "ðŸ§ª Running Jest tests..."
	@npm test

# Run Jest in watch mode
test-watch:
	@echo "ðŸ§ª Running Jest in watch mode..."
	@npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage report
test-coverage:
	@echo "ðŸ§ª Running tests with coverage..."
	@npm test -- --coverage
```

## Verification

### Test Files Configured
Jest finds 13 test files:

```
tests/unit/rate-limit-tracker.test.js
tests/unit/html-parser.test.js
tests/unit/tools.test.js
tests/unit/endpoints/search.test.js
tests/unit/model-selector.test.js
tests/google-sheets-snippets.test.js
tests/unit/request-analyzer.test.js
tests/unit/streaming.test.js
tests/integration/enhanced-model-selection.test.js
tests/integration/content-optimization-integration.test.js
tests/todos-manager.test.js
tests/integration/system_prompt_optimization.test.js
tests/integration/model-selection.test.js
```

### Package.json Configuration
The `package.json` already had Jest configured:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

---

## Usage

### Run All Tests
```bash
make test
```

### Watch Mode (Auto-Rerun on Changes)
```bash
make test-watch
```

### Coverage Report
```bash
make test-coverage
```

## Related Files

**Main Makefile**: `/home/stever/projects/lambdallmproxy/Makefile`
- Added test targets (lines ~370-380)
- Updated help section (lines ~80-85)
- Updated `.PHONY` declaration (line 6)

**whisper-rocm/Makefile**: `/home/stever/projects/lambdallmproxy/whisper-rocm/Makefile`
- Unchanged (test target remains for whisper-rocm specific tests)
- Should be run from within whisper-rocm/ directory only

**Jest Configuration**: `/home/stever/projects/lambdallmproxy/jest.config.json`
- Existing Jest configuration (no changes needed)

**Test Files**: `/home/stever/projects/lambdallmproxy/tests/`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/`

## Benefits

âœ… **Fixes**: Error when running `make test` from project root  
âœ… **Improves**: Developer experience with clear test commands  
âœ… **Adds**: Coverage and watch mode support via Makefile  
âœ… **Maintains**: Existing whisper-rocm test target (use from whisper-rocm/ dir)
