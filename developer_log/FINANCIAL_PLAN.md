## 2. Pricing Model & Revenue Mechanics

### 2.1 Pricing Structure

Research Agent offers three pricing options to accommodate different user needs:

#### Option 1: **BYO API Keys** (FREE Forever)
- Users connect their own OpenAI/Groq/Gemini keys
- **Cost to us**: $0 (users pay providers directly)
- **Revenue to us**: $0
- **Strategic value**: 
  - Viral growth (developers love free)
  - Upsell to paid when they hit rate limits
  - Community growth (open source contributors)

#### Option 2: **Prepaid Credits** (Pay-Per-Use)
- Users buy credits: $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500
- System charges: **LLM Provider Cost × 1.25** (25% margin)
- **Example**: 
  - User buys $20 credits
  - Makes query using gpt-4o-mini (50K input tokens, 10K output tokens)
  - Provider cost: $0.0075 + $0.0060 = $0.0135
  - We charge: $0.0135 × 1.25 = **$0.0169**
  - Our profit: $0.0034 (**25% gross margin**)

**Pricing Formula**:
```
User Cost = (Input Tokens / 1M × Input Price + Output Tokens / 1M × Output Price) × 1.25
```

**If user brings own key (isUserProvidedKey = true)**:
```
User Cost = Provider Cost × 1.00  (NO surcharge)
```

#### Option 3: **Subscription Plans** (Predictable MRR)

| Tier | Price | Included Credits | Overage Rate | Gross Margin |
|------|-------|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Individual** | $20/mo | $25 usage | Cost × 1.25 | ~80% |
| **Team** | $200/mo | $250 usage | Cost × 1.25 | ~75% |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Cost × 1.20 | ~65% |

**Margin Calculation** (Individual Plan):
- Revenue: $20
- Included credits: $25 worth of usage
- Avg user usage: $15 actual LLM cost
- Our LLM cost: $15
- Profit: $20 - $15 = $5
- **Gross margin**: 25% (if user uses all $25)
- **Actual margin**: 80% (if user uses $5, we pay $4)

**Why this works**:
- Most users overestimate usage → don't use full $25 → high margin
- Power users pay overage → margin still 25%
- Cannot lose money (worst case: 25% margin)

### 2.2 Cost Structure (Per Transaction)

#### Scenario A: User with Gemini Free (Most Common)

**Query**: 10K input tokens, 2K output tokens  
**Model**: gemini-2.0-flash  
**Provider cost** (paid tier pricing):
- Input: 10,000 / 1,000,000 × $0.075 = $0.00075
- Output: 2,000 / 1,000,000 × $0.30 = $0.00060
- **Total**: $0.00135

**Our charge** (25% surcharge):
- $0.00135 × 1.25 = **$0.00169**

**Our profit**: $0.00169 - $0.00135 = **$0.00034** (25% margin)

**AWS Lambda cost**:
- 1 invocation @ $0.0000002 = $0.0000002 (negligible)

**Net profit**: $0.00034 - $0.0000002 ≈ **$0.00034**

#### Scenario B: User with Groq Free

**Query**: 50K input tokens, 10K output tokens  
**Model**: llama-3.3-70b-versatile  
**Provider cost** (paid tier pricing):
- Input: 50,000 / 1,000,000 × $0.59 = $0.0295
- Output: 10,000 / 1,000,000 × $0.79 = $0.0079
- **Total**: $0.0374

**Our charge**: $0.0374 × 1.25 = **$0.04675**  
**Our profit**: $0.04675 - $0.0374 = **$0.01175** (25% margin)

#### Scenario C: User with OpenAI (High-Cost Model)

**Query**: 100K input tokens, 20K output tokens  
**Model**: gpt-4o  
**Provider cost**:
- Input: 100,000 / 1,000,000 × $2.50 = $0.25
- Output: 20,000 / 1,000,000 × $10.00 = $0.20
- **Total**: $0.45

**Our charge**: $0.45 × 1.25 = **$0.5625**  
**Our profit**: $0.5625 - $0.45 = **$0.1125** (25% margin)

#### Scenario D: BYO API Key (Zero Revenue, Zero Cost)

**Query**: Any  
**Provider cost**: Paid by user directly  
**Our charge**: $0  
**Our profit**: $0  
**Our cost**: $0.0000002 (Lambda invocation)  
**Net**: -$0.0000002 (negligible loss, worth it for virality)

### 2.3 Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

**Assumptions** (based on typical usage):
- 30 queries/month
- 20K input tokens, 4K output tokens per query
- 80% use Gemini Free, 15% use Groq Free, 5% use OpenAI

**Calculation**:

**Gemini Free users** (80%):
- Cost per query: $0.00135 × 1.25 = $0.00169
- 30 queries: $0.051/month
- ARPU: **$0.051** (not worth it, but drives engagement)

**Groq Free users** (15%):
- Cost per query: $0.0374 × 1.25 = $0.04675
- 30 queries: $1.40/month
- ARPU: **$1.40**

**OpenAI users** (5%):
- Cost per query: $0.45 × 1.25 = $0.5625
- 30 queries: $16.88/month
- ARPU: **$16.88**

**Blended ARPU**:
- (80% × $0.051) + (15% × $1.40) + (5% × $16.88) = **$1.05/month**

**Insight**: Free tier users are not profitable from usage alone, but:
1. Drive viral growth
2. Convert to paid plans ($20/mo) when they need more features
3. Provide valuable product feedback

### 2.4 Margin Analysis by Pricing Tier

#### BYO API Keys (Free Tier)

| **Net Profit** | **$1.54** | **$4.10** | **$16.70** |
| **Gross Margin** | **31%** | **21%** | **17%** |

**Note**: Gross margin decreases with higher usage (closer to 25% floor) but absolute profit increases.

#### Individual Plan ($20/mo)

| Metric | Low Usage | Medium Usage | High Usage |
|--------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Revenue | $20 | $20 | $20 |
| Included Credits | $25 | $25 | $25 |
| User's Actual LLM Cost | $5 | $15 | $30 |
| Our LLM Cost | $5 | $15 | $24 (cap at $25) |
| Overage Charge | $0 | $0 | $5 × 1.25 = $6.25 |
| Total Revenue | $20 | $20 | $26.25 |

| **Net Profit** | **$12.95** | **$2.95** | **$0.20** |
| **Gross Margin** | **65%** | **15%** | **1%** |

**Insight**: 
- Most users (~70%) are low usage → 60%+ margin
- Power users (20%) are medium usage → 15% margin
- Heavy users (10%) hit overage → break even or slight profit
- **Blended margin**: ~45% (healthy for SaaS)

#### Team Plan ($200/mo, 10 users)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | $200 |
| Included Credits | $250 |
| Actual Team Usage | $180 (blended across 10 users) |

| **Support (allocated)** | $2 | Assumes 10 mins support/user/mo @ $120/hr |
| **Total Variable Costs** | **$7.93-17.93** | Per paying user |

### 3.3 Gross Margin by Scenario

#### Scenario 1: 100% Free Users (BYO Keys)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Users | 500 |
| Revenue | $0 |
| LLM Cost | $0 |
| AWS Lambda | $25 (500 × $0.05) |
| **Gross Margin** | **-100%** (loss) |
| **Monthly Loss** | $25 |

**Strategic Value**: Worth the $25 loss for community growth and virality.

#### Scenario 2: 80% Free, 20% Paid (Realistic Early Stage)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Users | 500 |
| Free Users | 400 (BYO keys) |
| Paid Users | 100 ($20/mo avg) |
| Revenue | $2,000 |
| LLM Cost (paid users) | $1,000 (avg $10/user) |
| AWS Lambda | $25 |
| PayPal Fees | $88 |
| Support | $200 |
| **Total COGS** | **$1,313** |
| **Gross Profit** | **$687** |
| **Gross Margin** | **34%** |

#### Scenario 3: 50% Free, 50% Paid (Growth Stage)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Users | 5,000 |
| Free Users | 2,500 |
| Paid Users | 2,500 ($20/mo avg) |
| Revenue | $50,000 |
| LLM Cost | $25,000 |
| AWS Lambda | $250 |
| PayPal Fees | $2,200 |
| Support | $5,000 |
| **Total COGS** | **$32,450** |
| **Gross Profit** | **$17,550** |
| **Gross Margin** | **35%** |

#### Scenario 4: 30% Free, 60% Individual, 10% Team (Mature Stage)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Users | 20,000 |
| Free Users | 6,000 |
| Individual Users | 12,000 ($20/mo) |
| Team Users | 2,000 ($20/mo, part of teams) |
| Revenue | $20 × 12,000 + $200 × 100 (teams) = $260,000 |
| LLM Cost | $130,000 (50% of revenue) |
| AWS Lambda | $1,000 |
| PayPal Fees | $7,800 |
| Support | $20,000 |
| **Total COGS** | **$158,800** |
| **Gross Profit** | **$101,200** |
| **Gross Margin** | **39%** |

**Key Insight**: Gross margin improves as paid user % increases, but levels off around 35-40% due to:
1. LLM costs scale with usage
2. Support costs increase with user base
3. Cannot exceed 75% margin (25% surcharge floor)

### 3.4 Optimized Margin Strategy

#### Current Settings
- **LLM_MARGIN**: 25% (environment variable)
- **User-provided keys**: 0% surcharge (free)
- **Included credits**: $25 for $20 plan (80% overage protection)

#### Margin Optimization Scenarios

| Setting | Gross Margin | Competitive Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **15% surcharge** | ~13% | Very competitive, risky | ❌ Too thin |
| **20% surcharge** | ~16% | Competitive | ⚠️ Low but viable |
| **25% surcharge** (current) | ~20% | Fair pricing | ✅ Recommended |
| **30% surcharge** | ~23% | Above market | ⚠️ May hurt growth |
| **40% surcharge** | ~28% | Expensive | ❌ Uncompetitive |

**Recommendation**: **Keep 25% surcharge**
- Transparent, fair pricing
- Competitive with ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo unlimited vs our pay-per-use)
- Allows room for discounts/promotions
- Sustainable margins for growth

#### Included Credits Optimization

| Plan | Current Included | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2 | Optimal |
|------|------------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| **Individual** | $25 ($20 plan) | $20 ($20 plan) | $30 ($25 plan) | **$25** |
| **Team** | $250 ($200 plan) | $200 ($200 plan) | $300 ($250 plan) | **$250** |

**Reasoning for current settings**:
- $25 for $20 = 80% usage ceiling (encourages upgrade)
- Users perceive as "getting more value"
- We still profit if they use <$16 actual cost ($16 × 1.25 = $20)
- Avg user uses ~$10, so 50% margin in practice

## 5. Scenario Analysis

### 5.1 Scenario A: No Free Credits (User Pays from Day 1)

**Assumptions**:
- Remove $5 free credits
- Require credit purchase or BYO keys immediately

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Sign-up Rate | -50% (friction) |
| Conversion to Paid | +10% (committed users only) |
| Month 1 Users | 250 (vs 500) |
| Month 1 Paid Users | 75 (30% vs 18%) |
| Month 1 MRR | $1,500 |
| **Recommendation** | ❌ Bad for growth |

**Analysis**: Free credits are essential for:
1. Reducing signup friction
2. Allowing users to test value before paying
3. Building trust (try before you buy)

**Optimal Free Credit Amount**: $5 (current)
- Enough for 10-20 meaningful queries
- Low enough to not materially impact costs ($2.50/user after our margin)
- Industry standard (most AI tools offer $5-10 free)

### 5.2 Scenario B: Higher Free Credits ($10 vs $5)

**Assumptions**:
- Double free credits to $10

| Metric | $5 Credits | $10 Credits | Impact |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Sign-up Rate | 100% | 110% | +10% |
| Activation Rate (use 5+ times) | 20% | 25% | +5% |
| Conversion to Paid | 20% | 18% | -2% (less urgency) |
| Cost per User (free only) | $2.50 | $5.00 | +100% |
| **Month 1 Cost** | $1,000 | $2,750 | +175% |
| **Month 1 Revenue** | $2,000 | $1,980 | -1% |

**Recommendation**: **Keep $5**
- $10 credits reduce urgency to convert
- Cost doubles but revenue decreases
- $5 is sufficient for meaningful trial

### 5.3 Scenario C: Different Profit Margins

| Margin | 15% | 20% | 25% (Current) | 30% | 40% |
|--------|-----|-----|---------------|-----|-----|
| **User pays (for $10 LLM cost)** | $11.50 | $12.00 | $12.50 | $13.00 | $14.00 |
| **Our profit** | $1.50 | $2.00 | $2.50 | $3.00 | $4.00 |
| **Gross margin** | 13% | 17% | 20% | 23% | 29% |
| **Competitive vs ChatGPT** | Very | Strong | Fair | Weak | Poor |
| **Customer acquisition** | Easy | Good | Moderate | Hard | Very Hard |
| **Recommendation** | ⚠️ Risky | ✅ Good | ✅ Optimal | ⚠️ OK | ❌ Bad |

**Analysis**:
- **15%**: Too low, vulnerable to cost increases
- **20%**: Good balance, but less room for discounts
- **25%** (current): **Optimal** - fair, sustainable, competitive
- **30%**: Higher margin but may slow growth
- **40%**: Uncompetitive, only viable for enterprise with premium support

**Recommendation**: **25% margin (current setting is optimal)**

### 5.4 Scenario D: BYO Keys Only (No Hosted Service)

**Assumptions**:
- Remove all server-provided API keys
- Users must bring their own OpenAI/Groq/Gemini keys

| Metric | Current Model | BYO Only | Impact |
|--------|---------------|----------|--------|
| Addressable Market | 100% | 30% (devs only) | -70% |
| Revenue per User | $20/mo | $0 (or $5/mo SaaS fee?) | -100% |
| Gross Margin | 35% | N/A | - |
| Growth Rate | 20%/mo | 50%/mo (viral) | +150% |
| **Business Model** | SaaS | Open Source | - |

**Alternative Revenue Models for BYO-Only**:
1. **Donations**: GitHub Sponsors (~$500/mo realistic)
2. **SaaS Features**: $5/mo for advanced features (planning, RAG, sync)
3. **Enterprise Support**: $10K/year contracts for custom deployments
4. **Consulting**: $200/hr for implementation help

**Recommendation**: **Hybrid approach (current)**
- Offer both BYO keys (free) AND hosted service (paid)
- BYO keys drive virality and community
- Hosted service generates predictable revenue
- Upsell BYO users to hosted when they hit rate limits
