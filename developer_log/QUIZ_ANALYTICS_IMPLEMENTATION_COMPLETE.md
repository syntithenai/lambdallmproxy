# Quiz Analytics Implementation - Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Implementation Time**: ~4 hours

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive quiz analytics and performance tracking system. The system provides detailed insights into learning progress across topics and over time, including an analytics dashboard with topic performance tracking, score trends, question-level insights, achievements/milestones, and data export functionality.

## What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Storage ✅

**1. Enhanced Database Schema** (`ui-new/src/db/quizAnalyticsDb.ts`)

Created comprehensive IndexedDB schema with 4 object stores:

- **`quizResults`**: Stores complete quiz analytics with question-level stats
  - Tracks: timestamp, title, topics, score, time spent, question performance
  - Indexes: timestamp, sourceSnippetId, sourceFeedItemId, topics (multiEntry), synced

- **`topicPerformance`**: Aggregates performance data by topic
  - Tracks: quizzes taken, questions seen/correct, avg/best/worst scores, time spent, trend
  - Auto-calculates: improving/declining/stable trends

- **`achievements`**: Stores unlocked achievements and progress
  - 8 pre-defined achievements (first quiz, 10/50/100 quizzes, perfect score, 7/30 day streaks, 80% avg)

- **`studyStreak`**: Tracks consecutive study days
  - Singleton record with current streak, longest streak, streak dates array
  - Calculates consecutive days from midnight UTC timestamps

**2. Enhanced Quiz Tracking** (`ui-new/src/components/QuizCard.tsx`)

Modified QuizCard component to collect detailed analytics:
- Quiz start/end timestamps
- Time spent per question (tracks questionStartTime with useRef)
- Selected vs correct answers (text, not just IDs)
- Auto-saves analytics to IndexedDB on quiz completion
- Resets tracking on quiz restart

**3. Topic Extraction Algorithm**

Implemented keyword-based topic extraction:
- Searches for 30+ programming/tech keywords (ML, AI, Python, JavaScript, AWS, Docker, etc.)
- Extracts from quiz title + question text
- Assigns topics to individual questions
- Defaults to "General Knowledge" if no matches

### Phase 2: Analytics Dashboard UI ✅

**Created 6 React Components** (`ui-new/src/components/QuizAnalytics/`):

1. **OverviewStats.tsx** (~110 lines)
   - 6 stat cards: Total quizzes, avg score, questions answered, time spent, current/longest streaks
   - Auto-formatting for time (hours/minutes)
   - Loading/error states
   - Responsive grid layout

2. **TopicPerformance.tsx** (~140 lines)
   - Bar chart visualization (top 10 topics by score)
   - Color-coded bars (green ≥80%, blue ≥60%, orange ≥40%, red <40%)
   - Sortable table (by score or quizzes taken)
   - Displays: topic name, quizzes, avg/best/worst scores, trend indicator (📈/📉/➡️)
   - Uses recharts library

3. **ScoreTrends.tsx** (~130 lines)
   - Line chart with dual lines (quiz score + 5-quiz moving average)
   - Time range selector: Last 7 days / 30 days / All time
   - Trend insight banner ("You're improving!" or "Consider reviewing")
   - Empty state for no data

4. **QuestionInsights.tsx** (~100 lines)
   - Identifies most difficult questions (seen 2+ times, sorted by success rate)
   - Table with: question text, topic, attempts, success rate, avg time
   - Color-coded success rates (red <50%, orange ≥50%)
   - Empty state for insufficient data

5. **Achievements.tsx** (~120 lines)
   - Grid layout of 8 achievement cards
   - Visual progress bars for locked achievements
   - Unlocked cards: green gradient, checkmark, shadow effect
   - Locked cards: grayscale, opacity 0.6
   - Auto-calculates progress based on quiz data

6. **QuizAnalyticsPage.tsx** (~100 lines)
   - Main dashboard component
   - Header with title, subtitle, and 3 action buttons:
     - **Refresh**: Reload all analytics data
     - **Export CSV**: Download quiz data as CSV file
     - **Clear Data**: Delete all analytics (double confirmation)
   - Assembles all sub-components
   - Key-based refresh mechanism

**Styling** (6 CSS files):
- Consistent color scheme (blue, green, orange, red)
- Dark mode support for all components
- Responsive design (grid → single column on mobile)
- Hover animations (lift effect, shadow)
- Icon-based visual feedback

### Phase 3: Data Export & Privacy ✅

**CSV Export Functionality**

Implemented in `quizAnalyticsDb.exportToCSV()`:
- Headers: Quiz ID, Timestamp, Title, Topics, Total Questions, Correct Answers, Score, Time Spent, Start/End Time
- CSV formatting: Quoted fields, comma-separated
- Browser download via Blob + createObjectURL
- Filename: `quiz-analytics-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

**Data Deletion**

Implemented in `QuizAnalyticsPage`:
- Double confirmation dialog with explicit warnings
- Clears all 4 IndexedDB stores
- Forces dashboard refresh after deletion
- Recommends export before delete

**Future: Google Sheets Sync** (Planned, not implemented)
- Backend endpoint: `POST /api/quiz/sync`
- Sync trigger: After each quiz completion (if enabled)
- Sheet format: Same as CSV columns
- Batch sync: Sync all unsynced quizzes
- Settings UI: Enable/disable toggle, sync status

### Phase 4: Testing ✅

**Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/quiz-analytics.test.js`)

Created 13 comprehensive tests covering:

1. **Data Collection** (3 tests)
   - Quiz completion tracking with detailed analytics
   - Topic extraction from quiz content
   - Question-level performance tracking

2. **Study Streak Calculation** (2 tests)
   - Consecutive day streak calculation (3 days = 3 streak)
   - Streak reset on missed day (gap breaks streak)

3. **Topic Performance Aggregation** (2 tests)
   - Average score calculation per topic
   - Trend identification (improving/declining/stable)

4. **Achievement System** (2 tests)
   - Achievement unlocking based on progress
   - Progress tracking towards locked achievements

5. **Question Insights** (1 test)
   - Identifying most difficult questions by success rate

6. **CSV Export** (1 test)
   - CSV format validation with headers and data rows

7. **Dashboard Rendering** (2 tests)
   - Overview statistics display
   - Time formatting (hours/minutes)

**Test Results**: ✅ 13/13 passing (0.581s)

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User Completes Quiz
    ↓
QuizCard.handleNext()
    ↓
quizAnalyticsDb.saveQuizResult()
    ↓
├─> Save to quizResults store
├─> Extract topics (keyword matching)
├─> Update topicPerformance (aggregation)
└─> Update studyStreak (consecutive days)
    ↓
Dashboard Auto-Refreshes
    ↓
├─> OverviewStats (load quiz data + streak)
├─> ScoreTrends (filter by time range)
├─> TopicPerformance (aggregate by topic)
├─> QuestionInsights (aggregate by question text)
└─> Achievements (calculate progress)
```

### Database Schema

```typescript
IndexedDB: quiz_analytics (version 1)

Stores:
  - quizResults (keyPath: id)
    - Indexes: timestamp, sourceSnippetId, sourceFeedItemId, topics, synced
  
  - topicPerformance (keyPath: topic)
    - Indexes: lastQuizDate, averageScore
  
  - achievements (keyPath: id)
    - Indexes: unlocked
  
  - studyStreak (keyPath: id)
    - Single record (id: 1)
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **IndexedDB Indexing**
   - All list queries use indexed cursors (fast)
   - Multi-entry index on topics array (efficient filtering)

2. **Lazy Loading**
   - Dashboard components load data independently
   - No blocking between components
   - Loading states for UX

3. **Caching**
   - Topic performance cached in separate store (no re-aggregation)
   - Achievements cached and updated on demand

4. **Efficient Aggregation**
   - Moving average calculated in-memory (no DB queries)
   - Question difficulty uses Map for O(n) aggregation
