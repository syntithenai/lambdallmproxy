# Current Date/Time Injection - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ Status: DEPLOYED

The system now injects the current date and time into every chat request's system prompt.

## üïí What Was Added

### UI Changes (ChatTab.tsx)

**Before each request**, the UI now:
1. Gets the current date and time
2. Formats it in a user-friendly way
3. Injects it at the **beginning** of the system prompt

**Example injection:**
```
**CURRENT DATE AND TIME:**
Friday, October 11, 2025, 05:39:04 PM EDT (ISO: 2025-10-11T21:39:04.123Z)

You have access to the current date and time above. Use this information when responding to temporal queries about "today", "current date", "what time is it", "this week", "this month", "this year", etc. You do not need to use tools to get the current date/time as it is provided in this system prompt.

[User's custom system prompt or default]
[Tool usage instructions]
```

## üìã Implementation Details

### Code Location
**File:** `ui-new/src/components/ChatTab.tsx`
**Lines:** ~870-900

### Format Details
The date/time is formatted as:
- **Full date**: "Friday, October 11, 2025"
- **Time with timezone**: "05:39:04 PM EDT"
- **ISO 8601**: "2025-10-11T21:39:04.123Z"

This provides:
- Human-readable format for the LLM
- Timezone information
- Precise ISO timestamp for calculations

### When It's Injected
- **Every request** to the chat endpoint
- **Before** the user's custom system prompt
- **Before** tool usage instructions

## üéØ Benefits

### 1. Accurate Temporal Awareness
The LLM now knows:
- Today's date
- Current time
- Day of the week
- Current year
- Timezone

### 2. Better Query Handling
Queries like these now work correctly:
- "What's today's date?"
- "What day is it?"
- "What time is it?"
- "What events happened this week?"
- "What's happening in October 2025?"
- "How long until the end of the year?"

### 3. No Tool Calls Needed
The LLM doesn't need to:
- Call search_web to get the date
- Use execute_javascript for date calculations
- Guess or hallucinate dates

### 4. Consistent Across Requests
Every request gets a fresh, accurate timestamp.

## üìä Example Behavior

### Before (Without Date/Time)
**User:** "What's today's date?"
**LLM:** "I don't have access to the current date. Let me search for it..." [calls search_web unnecessarily]

### After (With Date/Time)
**User:** "What's today's date?"
**LLM:** "Today is Friday, October 11, 2025."

---

**User:** "What events are happening this week?"
**LLM:** [Knows it's October 11, 2025, searches for "events October 11-17 2025"]

---

**User:** "How many days until Christmas?"
**LLM:** [Knows it's October 11, calculates: December 25 - October 11 = 75 days]

## üîç Where It Applies

### ‚úÖ Chat Tab
Every message sent through the Chat interface includes current date/time.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Planning Tab
The Planning tab uses a different endpoint and may not include this injection.
(Could be added if needed)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Direct API Calls
If calling the `/chat` endpoint directly (not through the UI), clients should include their own date/time in the system prompt.

## üß™ Testing

### Test Queries
Try these to verify it's working:

1. **Simple date query:**
   ```
   What's today's date?
   ```
   Should respond with: "Friday, October 11, 2025" (or current date)

2. **Time query:**
   ```
   What time is it?
   ```
   Should respond with current time and timezone.

3. **Contextual query:**
   ```
   What major tech events are happening this month?
   ```
   Should know it's October 2025 and search accordingly.

4. **Relative date:**
   ```
   What happened last week?
   ```
   Should understand last week relative to October 11, 2025.

## üìù Notes

### Date/Time Source
- Uses JavaScript `Date()` object
- Based on **user's browser timezone**
- Updates with each new request (not cached)

### Timezone Handling
- Shows user's local timezone (e.g., "EDT", "PST")
- Also includes ISO 8601 UTC timestamp
- LLM can handle timezone conversions if needed

### Performance Impact
- Minimal: Just formatting a timestamp
- No API calls or external dependencies
- Happens client-side before request

## üîÑ Backend Comparison

The backend (`src/config/prompts.js`) already had this feature in the `getComprehensiveResearchSystemPrompt()` function, but it was **NOT being used** by the chat endpoint.

**Backend function:** Used by the old lambda handler
**New UI injection:** Used by the chat endpoint (current system)

This ensures **consistent date/time awareness** across all requests.

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add to Planning tab as well
2. Allow users to override timezone in settings
3. Add option to disable if not needed
4. Include additional context (season, holidays, etc.)
