## Implementation Details

### URL Format
- **Pattern**: `#/snippet/shared?data=<compressed>`
- **Encoding**: LZ-String compression (same as chat share)
- **Size Limit**: ~32KB (Chrome URL limit)
- **Compression Ratio**: ~60-70% for text content

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface SharedSnippet {
  version: number;
  timestamp: number;
  shareType: 'snippet';
  id: string;
  content: string;
  title?: string;
  tags?: string[];
  sourceType?: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'tool';
  metadata?: {
    compressed: boolean;
    originalSize: number;
    compressedSize?: number;
  };
}
```

### Authentication Flow
1. **Unauthenticated User**:
   - Views shared snippet without login
   - Clicks "Login & Chat" → Redirects to login page
   - After login → Redirects to main chat

2. **Authenticated User**:
   - Views shared snippet
   - Clicks "Back to Chat" → Direct to chat interface

### Share Button Locations
1. **SwagPage.tsx** (Line 1620):
   - Share icon button in snippet card
   - Blue background, white icon
   - Tooltip: "Share snippet"
   - Opens SnippetShareDialog on click

### Social Sharing Options
- **Twitter**: Share with custom text and URL
- **Reddit**: Share to Reddit with title
- **Email**: Compose email with subject and URL
- **QR Code**: Mobile scanning support
- **Direct Copy**: Clipboard copy with visual feedback

## Build Verification

### Build Status: ✅ SUCCESS

```bash
$ cd ui-new && npm run build
✓ built in 23.17s
```

**Issues Fixed**:
- Removed unused `useNavigate` import from ChatTab.tsx
- Build completed without TypeScript errors

### Bundle Size
- No chunk size warnings for snippet components
- All components tree-shakeable

## Usage Examples

### Sharing a Snippet

1. Go to Swag page (`/swag`)
2. Find a snippet you want to share
3. Click the blue share icon button
4. Share dialog opens with:
   - Snippet preview (title, tags, content excerpt)
   - Generated shareable URL
   - QR code
   - Social sharing buttons
5. Click "Copy" to copy URL to clipboard
6. Or click social share button to share directly

### Viewing a Shared Snippet

1. Receive shared URL: `https://example.com/#/snippet/shared?data=...`
2. Open URL in browser (no login required)
3. Snippet displays in full-screen viewer with:
   - Title and metadata at top
   - Tags (if any)
   - Full content with markdown rendering
   - Code syntax highlighting
   - "Back to Chat" button in header
4. Click "Back to Chat":
   - If not logged in: Redirects to login page
   - If logged in: Navigates to chat interface

### Example URL

```
https://example.com/#/snippet/shared?data=NoIgdghgtgpiBcIAuAnA...
```

The `data` parameter contains:
- Compressed snippet content (LZ-String)
- Title, tags, metadata
- Version and timestamp
- Source type (user/assistant/tool)

## Known Limitations

1. **URL Length**: Maximum ~32KB (Chrome limit)
   - Average snippet: ~5-10KB uncompressed → ~2-4KB compressed
   - Max safe snippet: ~20KB uncompressed content
   - Solution: Warn users if snippet exceeds limit

2. **Browser Support**: 
   - Modern browsers only (ES2020+)
   - Requires JavaScript enabled
   - QR code generation needs canvas support

3. **Offline Support**:
   - Works once loaded (data in URL)
   - Initial load requires network
   - QR code generation requires network

- [ ] Share analytics (view count, if desired)
- [ ] Social media preview cards (Open Graph meta tags)
- [ ] "Save to my snippets" button (for logged-in viewers)
- [ ] Export as markdown file
- [ ] Print-friendly view
- [ ] Syntax highlighting theme selection

### Potential Improvements
