# Fix: Evaluation Display and Calculation Tool Usage

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Completed and Deployed  
**Deployment**: Backend (deploy-lambda-fast), UI (deploy-ui)

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Response Evaluation Display Location ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Response evaluation was showing in chat response blocks, cluttering the UI.  
**Expected**: Evaluations should be in the LLM transparency dialog (info button).

**Solution**:
- Removed evaluation display from `ChatTab.tsx` (lines 3238-3260)
- Added `evaluations` prop to `LlmInfoDialogProps` interface
- Added evaluation section to `LlmInfoDialog.tsx` after API calls section
- Updated `ChatTab.tsx` to pass evaluations to dialog: `evaluations={(messages[showLlmInfo] as any).evaluations}`

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner chat interface
- Evaluation details accessible via Info button
- Better organization of technical information
- Token info and pricing already shown in totals

### 2. Empty Response from Groq for Calculation Queries ‚úÖ
**Problem**: When asking "Calculate the compound interest on $10,000 invested at 7% annual rate for 15 years", Groq returned empty response (completion_tokens=0) without calling tools.

**Root Causes**:
1. Generic system prompt didn't guide LLM to use tools for calculations
2. `execute_javascript` tool description wasn't explicit enough about when to use it

**Solutions**:

#### A. Enhanced System Prompt (`src/endpoints/chat.js`)
```javascript
// Added tool guidance to default system prompt
messages.unshift({
    role: 'system',
    content: 'You are a helpful AI assistant with access to powerful tools. For calculations, math problems, or data processing, use the execute_javascript tool. For current information or research, use search_web. For diagrams and charts, use generate_chart. Always use tools when they can provide better answers than your training data.'
});
```

**Before**: `'You are a helpful AI assistant.'`  
**After**: Explicit guidance about when to use each tool

#### B. Improved Tool Description (`src/tools.js`)
```javascript
{
  name: 'execute_javascript',
  description: 'üßÆ **PRIMARY TOOL FOR ALL CALCULATIONS AND MATH**: Execute JavaScript code in a secure sandbox environment. **MANDATORY USE** when user asks for: calculations, math problems, compound interest, percentages, conversions, data processing, algorithms, or any numerical computation. Also use for demonstrations and code examples. **ALWAYS call this tool for math instead of trying to calculate in your response.** Returns the console output and execution result. Use console.log() to display results. Example: For compound interest, use: "const principal = 10000; const rate = 0.07; const time = 15; const amount = principal * Math.pow(1 + rate, time); console.log(`Final amount: $${amount.toFixed(2)}`);". Call this tool with ONLY the code parameter - never include result, output, type, or executed_at fields as these are generated automatically.',
  // ... parameters
}
```

**Changes**:
- Added üßÆ emoji and "PRIMARY TOOL FOR ALL CALCULATIONS AND MATH"
- **MANDATORY USE** directive for specific use cases
- Listed explicit scenarios: calculations, math, compound interest, percentages, conversions
- **ALWAYS call this tool for math** instruction
- Compound interest example in description
- Clearer guidance about what NOT to include

### 3. Proxy Instructions Link ‚úÖ
**Problem**: User wanted proxy instructions to show `https://dashboard.webshare.io/dashboard`  
**Status**: Already correct in `ui-new/src/components/SettingsModal.tsx` line 441

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `src/endpoints/chat.js`:
  - Lines 649-662: Enhanced system prompt with tool guidance
- `src/tools.js`:
  - Lines 389-415: Enhanced `execute_javascript` tool description

### Frontend
- `ui-new/src/components/ChatTab.tsx`:
  - Lines 3238-3260: Removed evaluation display
  - Line 4052: Pass evaluations to LlmInfoDialog
- `ui-new/src/components/LlmInfoDialog.tsx`:
  - Lines 21-24: Added Evaluation interface
  - Lines 26-28: Updated LlmInfoDialogProps
  - Line 34: Accept evaluations prop
  - Lines 412-434: Added evaluation display section

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Evaluation Display
1. Ask a question that triggers evaluation
2. Click Info button on assistant message
3. **Expected**: Evaluation section shows at bottom of dialog
4. **Expected**: No evaluation shown in chat response block

### Test Case 2: Calculation Query
1. Ask: "Calculate the compound interest on $10,000 invested at 7% annual rate for 15 years"
2. **Expected**: LLM calls `execute_javascript` tool
3. **Expected**: Response includes calculation result
4. **Expected**: NO empty response

### Test Case 3: Other Math Queries
- "What is 15% of 250?"
- "Convert 100 miles to kilometers"
- "Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5"
- **Expected**: All trigger `execute_javascript` tool

## CloudWatch Logs Analysis

**Before Fix**:
```
üîß DEBUG Tool calls: total=0, valid=0, hasToolCalls=false
üîç Tool execution decision: hasToolCalls=false
‚úÖ Treating response as final - no tool calls
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Empty response detected with no tool calls
   Iteration: 1, finishReason: null
   Total messages: 4
   Using error fallback (no tool results)
```

**After Fix** (expected):
```
üîß Tool calls detected: execute_javascript
üîç Executing tool: execute_javascript
‚úÖ Tool execution successful
üì§ Sending final response with calculation result
```

## Impact

### Positive
- ‚úÖ Cleaner chat UI (evaluations hidden)
- ‚úÖ Better tool usage for calculations
- ‚úÖ More reliable responses for math queries
- ‚úÖ Explicit system guidance for LLM behavior

### Potential Issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly longer system prompt (minor token increase)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May need monitoring to ensure tool calls work across all models

## Related Issues

- **generate_chart tool**: Previously fixed - added to toolFunctions array (see earlier conversation)
- **Proxy instructions**: Already correct, no changes needed

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test calculation queries with Groq
2. ‚úÖ Verify evaluation display in dialog
3. ‚úÖ Monitor CloudWatch logs for tool calls
4. üìù Consider adding examples to other tool descriptions
5. üìù May need similar enhancements for other providers (Claude, GPT-4)

## Notes

- System prompt enhancement applies when NO system message exists
- If user provides custom system message, it's preserved and merged
- Tool description changes apply to ALL providers (Groq, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.)
- Evaluation section styled consistently with rest of dialog (purple theme)
