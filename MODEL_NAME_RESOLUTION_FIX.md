# Model Name Resolution Fix - groq-free:undefined

## Issue
The planning endpoint was throwing HTTP 404 errors:
```
Error: HTTP 404: {"error":{"message":"The model `groq-free:undefined` does not exist or you do not have access to it.","type":"invalid_request_error","code":"model_not_found"}}
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by inconsistent property access in the model selection logic:

1. **Model Object Structure**: In the provider catalog (`PROVIDER_CATALOG.json`), models have an `id` property:
   ```json
   "llama-3.1-8b-instant": {
     "id": "llama-3.1-8b-instant",
     "category": "small",
     ...
   }
   ```

2. **Console Logging vs Final Usage**: The planning endpoint had inconsistent property access:
   - **Console log** (line 141): Used fallback logic `selectedModel.name || selectedModel.id` ✅
   - **Final model string** (line 149): Only used `selectedModel.name` ❌

3. **Result**: When `selectedModel.name` was `undefined`, the final model became `groq-free:undefined`

## Solution Implemented
Fixed the final model construction to use the same fallback logic as the console logging:

**Before:**
```javascript
const finalModel = `${selectedModel.providerType}:${selectedModel.name}`;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const modelName = selectedModel.name || selectedModel.id;
const finalModel = `${selectedModel.providerType}:${modelName}`;
```

## Files Modified
- `src/endpoints/planning.js` - Line 149: Added fallback logic for model name resolution

## Verification
✅ **Logs confirm fix**: No more `groq-free:undefined` errors in recent logs
✅ **Model selection working**: "Model selected" logs show proper model resolution  
✅ **API calls successful**: "Using actual usage data from groq-free" shows working requests
✅ **Planning endpoint functional**: Requests are properly routed and processed

## Impact
- **Planning endpoint**: Now properly resolves model names for API calls
- **Model selection**: Consistent property access across all usage patterns
- **Error prevention**: Prevents HTTP 404 model_not_found errors
- **System stability**: Planning functionality now works reliably

The fix ensures that model names are consistently resolved using the same fallback logic throughout the codebase, preventing undefined model name issues in API requests.
