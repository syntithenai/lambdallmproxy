# Phase 4-10: Implementation Phases Summary

## Phase 4: Provider Integration Layer
**Objective**: Abstract provider-specific implementations into a unified interface

### Key Deliverables
- Abstract Provider interface with standard methods
- Gemini API integration (free + paid tiers)
- Cohere API integration (free + paid tiers)  
- Mistral API integration
- OpenAI-compatible provider adapter
- Standardized response format converter

### Files to Create
- `src/providers/base-provider.js` - Abstract interface
- `src/providers/groq-provider.js` - Refactor existing
- `src/providers/openai-provider.js` - Refactor existing
- `src/providers/gemini-provider.js` - New
- `src/providers/cohere-provider.js` - New
- `src/providers/mistral-provider.js` - New
- `src/providers/openai-compatible-provider.js` - New
- `src/providers/provider-factory.js` - Factory pattern

### Critical Considerations
- Each provider has different API formats
- Streaming implementations vary (SSE vs custom)
- Tool/function calling syntax differs
- Error codes and rate limit headers not standardized

---

## Phase 5: Intelligent Model Selection
**Objective**: Implement smart model selection with token awareness and rate limit tracking

### Key Deliverables
- Model categorization system (small/large/reasoning)
- Request type detection algorithm
- Token estimation and cost calculation
- Rate limit state tracker (per-provider, per-model)
- Model selection algorithm prioritizing free tiers
- State persistence layer (DynamoDB or in-memory with TTL)

### Files to Create
- `src/model-selection/categorizer.js` - Model categorization
- `src/model-selection/request-analyzer.js` - Detect request type
- `src/model-selection/token-calculator.js` - Estimate tokens
- `src/model-selection/rate-limit-tracker.js` - Track usage state
- `src/model-selection/selector.js` - Main selection logic
- `src/model-selection/state-store.js` - Persistent state

### Algorithm Priorities
1. Free tier providers with available capacity
2. Model category match (small/large/reasoning)
3. Context window sufficient for request
4. Cost optimization within acceptable quality
5. Round-robin among suitable options

---

## Phase 6: Request Routing & Load Balancing
**Objective**: Implement intelligent request routing with state-aware load balancing

### Key Deliverables
- Round-robin scheduler for free providers
- Rate limit checking before requests
- Response header parsing for limit updates
- State update after each request
- Circuit breaker for failing providers

### Files to Create
- `src/routing/load-balancer.js` - Request distribution
- `src/routing/health-checker.js` - Provider health monitoring
- `src/routing/circuit-breaker.js` - Failure protection
- `src/routing/request-router.js` - Main routing logic

### State Management
- Track per-provider: requests/min, tokens/min, failures
- Reset counters based on rate limit windows
- Mark providers unavailable on repeated failures
- Auto-recover after cooldown period

---

## Phase 7: Retry & Failover Logic
**Objective**: Implement resilient error handling with automatic retry

### Key Deliverables
- 429 rate limit error detection
- Automatic provider switching on failure
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Maximum retry limit enforcement (3 attempts)
- Error aggregation and reporting

### Files to Create
- `src/retry/retry-handler.js` - Retry orchestration
- `src/retry/error-classifier.js` - Categorize errors
- `src/retry/backoff-strategy.js` - Timing logic

### Retry Flow
1. Request fails with 429/500 error
2. Mark provider as temporarily unavailable
3. Select next best available provider
4. Retry request (up to 3 times)
5. If all fail, return aggregated error

---

## Phase 8: Whisper/Transcription Multi-Provider
**Objective**: Extend multi-provider logic to Whisper transcription

### Key Deliverables
- Whisper provider abstraction
- Provider rotation for transcription
- Failover on transcription errors
- Audio format compatibility checking

### Files to Modify
- `src/endpoints/transcribe.js` - Use provider pool
- `src/providers/*/whisper.js` - Provider-specific Whisper

### Whisper Provider Support
- **OpenAI**: Native Whisper-large-v3
- **Groq**: Whisper-large-v3 (check availability)
- **Replicate**: Various Whisper models
- **Gemini**: No direct Whisper (use speech-to-text)

---

## Phase 9: Testing & Validation
**Objective**: Comprehensive testing across all components

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests (100+ tests)
- Provider interface implementations
- Model selection algorithm
- Rate limit tracking
- Token estimation accuracy
- Retry logic
- State management

#### Integration Tests (50+ tests)
- Full request flow with multiple providers
- Provider failover scenarios
- Rate limit enforcement
- Cost calculation accuracy
- State persistence and recovery

#### Load Tests
- Concurrent requests (100+ simultaneous)
- Rate limit exhaustion scenarios
- Provider pool under stress
- Memory and performance profiling

#### E2E Tests
- Complete user flows

## Phase 10: Migration & Deployment
**Objective**: Safe rollout with monitoring and rollback capability

### Migration Strategy

#### Week 1: Canary Deployment
- Deploy to 5% of traffic
- Monitor error rates, latency, costs
- Rollback plan ready

#### Week 2: Gradual Rollout
- Increase to 25% traffic
- Validate free tier usage increase
- Monitor provider distribution

#### Week 3: Full Deployment
- 100% traffic on new system
- Decommission old code paths
- Monitor for 48 hours

### Monitoring Dashboard
- Requests per provider
- Free tier vs paid usage ratio
- Average cost per request
- Error rates by provider
- Rate limit near-misses
- Failover frequency

### Rollback Triggers
- Error rate > 1%
- Cost increase > 50%
- Average latency > 2x baseline
- Any provider consistently failing

---

## Cross-Phase Concerns

### Security
- API key encryption at rest
- No keys in logs or error messages
- Rate limiting per user
- Input validation and sanitization

### Performance
- <100ms provider selection overhead
- <50ms state lookup
- Minimal memory footprint
- Connection pooling for providers

### Cost Management
- Alert on unexpected paid API usage
- Daily cost reports
- Automatic fallback to cheaper providers
- User cost visibility

### Observability
- Structured logging
- Request tracing
- Provider performance metrics
- User behavior analytics

## Risk Mitigation Summary

### High-Risk Areas
1. **State Management**: Use DynamoDB with TTL, accept eventual consistency
2. **Breaking Changes**: Implement versioning, provide migration tools
3. **Provider API Changes**: Monitor provider docs, have adapter pattern
4. **Cost Overruns**: Hard limits, alerts, circuit breakers

### Contingency Plans
1. **Rollback**: Feature flags allow instant revert to old system
2. **Provider Failure**: Always maintain 1+ paid fallback provider
3. **Authentication Issues**: Temporary bypass for critical users
4. **Performance**: Auto-scale Lambda, optimize hot paths
