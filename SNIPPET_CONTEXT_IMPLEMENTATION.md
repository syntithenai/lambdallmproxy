# Snippet Context Selection Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented manual snippet context selection system that extends the automatic RAG system by allowing users to explicitly attach full snippets as context to their chat messages.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New SnippetSelector Component
**File:** `ui-new/src/components/SnippetSelector.tsx`

A comprehensive snippet selection component with:
- **Text Search**: Filter snippets by title/content keywords in real-time
- **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity search using embeddings with similarity scores
- **Tag Filtering**: Multi-select tag filter using TagAutocomplete component
- **Selection UI**: 
  - Checkbox for multi-select
  - Click to toggle individual snippets
  - Select All / Clear buttons
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Shows similarity scores for vector search results
  - Displays snippet previews with title, content, tags
  - Highlights selected snippets
  - Shows selection count

### 2. ChatTab Integration
**File:** `ui-new/src/components/ChatTab.tsx`

#### State Management
- Added `selectedSnippetIds: Set<string>` state to track selected snippets
- State persists across the chat session until explicitly cleared

#### UI Changes
- **Button Update**: Changed "üìù Snippets" to "üìé Attach Context" with badge showing count
- **Tooltip**: Added explanation that this attaches knowledge base snippets as context
- **Visual Indicator**: Blue banner above input showing attached snippets with titles (shows first 3, then "+N more")
- **Clear Button**: X button to remove all attached snippets

#### Message Array Integration
When sending a message with attached snippets:
1. Retrieves full content of selected snippets from SwagContext
2. Creates context messages with format:
   ```
   role: 'user'
   content: '**KNOWLEDGE BASE CONTEXT** (manually attached by user):\n\n**Title:** ...\n\n{full snippet content}\n\n---\n'
   ```
3. Injects these BEFORE the user message in the messages array
4. Order: System Prompt ‚Üí Auto RAG Fragments ‚Üí Manual Full Snippets ‚Üí User Message

#### Persistence
- **Save**: Stores `selectedSnippetIds` array in chat metadata when auto-saving to IndexedDB
- **Load**: Restores selection when loading chat from history or on page refresh
- **Clear**: Clears selection when:
  - Starting new chat
  - After sending message
  - Clicking clear button

### 3. Key Differences from Automatic RAG

| Feature | Automatic RAG | Manual Snippet Selection |
|---------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Trigger | Always runs if enabled | User explicitly selects |
| Content | Small chunks/fragments | Full snippet content |
| Selection | Algorithm decides | User decides |
| Visibility | Background process | Clear visual indication |
| Persistence | Per-message | Can persist across messages |

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User clicks "üìé Attach Context" button
2. Panel opens with search/filter options
3. User can:
   - Type text query to filter snippets
   - Click "Semantic Search" and enter query for vector search
   - Select tags to filter by topic
4. Snippets appear with previews
5. User clicks checkboxes or snippets directly to select
6. Selected snippets show in blue banner above input
7. When user sends message, full snippet content is included as context
8. LLM receives complete snippets before the question

### Technical Flow
```
User selects snippets
  ‚Üì
State: selectedSnippetIds updated (Set<string>)
  ‚Üì
Visual indicator shows count and titles
  ‚Üì
User sends message (handleSendMessage)
  ‚Üì
Fetch full snippets from SwagContext by ID
  ‚Üì
Create context messages with full content
  ‚Üì
Build messages array:
  [system, auto-rag, manual-snippets, history, user-msg]
  ‚Üì
Send to backend /chat endpoint
  ‚Üì
LLM sees full snippet context
  ‚Üì
Clear selection after sending
  ‚Üì
Save selection to IndexedDB metadata
```

## Code Documentation

The SnippetSelector component includes extensive comments explaining:
- Purpose of manual vs automatic RAG
- How data flows from selection to backend
- Integration with messages array
- State management approach
- Search/filter implementations

## Files Modified

1. **ui-new/src/components/SnippetSelector.tsx** - New file (444 lines)
   - Complete snippet selection UI
   - Text and vector search
   - Tag filtering
   - Selection management

2. **ui-new/src/components/ChatTab.tsx** - Modified
   - Import SnippetSelector instead of SnippetsPanel
   - Added `selectedSnippetIds` state
   - Added `swagSnippets` from useSwag
   - Updated button label and added badge
   - Added visual indicator above input
   - Integrated snippet content into messages array
   - Added persistence in saveChatToHistory
   - Added restoration in loadChatWithMetadata
   - Clear on new chat and after send

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Text search filters snippets correctly
- [ ] Vector search shows relevant results with similarity scores
- [ ] Tag filtering works with multi-select
- [ ] Checkbox selection works
- [ ] Click to toggle works
- [ ] Select All / Clear buttons work
- [ ] Badge shows correct count
- [ ] Visual indicator shows snippet titles
- [ ] Clear button removes all selections
- [ ] Full snippet content sent to backend (check console logs)
- [ ] LLM uses snippet context in responses
- [ ] Selection persists when reloading page
- [ ] Selection loads correctly from chat history
- [ ] Selection clears on new chat
- [ ] Selection clears after sending message

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** - Go through checklist above
2. **Verify backend** - Check that LLM receives and uses full snippet content
3. **User feedback** - Adjust UI based on actual usage
4. **Consider enhancements**:
   - Option to persist selection across messages (sticky mode)
   - Show which snippets were attached to each message in history
   - Bulk operations (attach all search results)
   - Keyboard shortcuts for selection

## Known Limitations

1. Selection is per-chat, not per-message (cleared after sending)
2. No way to see which snippets were attached to past messages (could be added)
3. Large snippets might hit context window limits (no warning yet)
4. Vector search requires embeddings to be generated first

## Summary

The implementation successfully transforms the snippet panel from a confusing management tool into a clear context attachment system. Users now have explicit control over which knowledge base snippets are included in their conversations, complementing the automatic RAG system with manually curated context.
