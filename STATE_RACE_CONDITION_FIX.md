# State Clearing Race Condition Fix

**Date**: 2025-01-08 04:15 UTC  
**Issue**: Old LLM responses still visible when clicking examples  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Description

When users clicked example prompts, the old chat messages were still visible in the UI even though `setMessages([])` was being called. The new example query would be sent, but the old conversation remained on screen.

## Root Cause

**React State Update Asynchronicity**: React state updates are asynchronous and batched. When we called:

```tsx
setMessages([]);        // Queue state update
handleSend(exampleText); // Called immediately
```

The `handleSend` function was executing **before React had finished processing the `setMessages([])` update**. This caused a race condition where:

1. `setMessages([])` queues the state update
2. `handleSend()` reads the current (old) messages from its closure
3. React processes the state update (too late)
4. New message gets appended to the old messages array

## Solution

Wrapped the `handleSend` call in `setTimeout(..., 0)` to defer execution until after React processes all pending state updates:

```tsx
// Clear all state
setMessages([]);
setSystemPrompt('');
// ... more state clearing ...

// Use setTimeout to ensure React finishes processing state updates
// before sending the new message (avoids race conditions)
setTimeout(() => {
  handleSend(exampleText);
}, 0);
```

### How setTimeout(fn, 0) Works

`setTimeout(fn, 0)` doesn't execute the function in 0ms. Instead, it:

1. **Adds the function to the event queue** (macrotask)
2. **Allows React to finish** processing all pending state updates (microtasks)
3. **Then executes** the function once the call stack is clear

This ensures all `setState` calls have been processed before `handleSend` runs.

## Technical Details

### Event Loop Order

```
1. Synchronous code executes
   └─> setMessages([])
   └─> setSystemPrompt('')
   └─> setTimeout(() => handleSend(), 0)  // Queued

2. React processes state updates (microtasks)
   └─> messages = []
   └─> systemPrompt = ''

3. Event queue processes (macrotasks)
   └─> handleSend(exampleText)  // Now sees empty messages
```

### Alternative Solutions Considered

1. **useEffect with dependency**: Too complex, would fire on every state change
2. **flushSync (React 18)**: Forces synchronous updates but hurts performance
3. **setTimeout(fn, 0)**: ✅ Simple, effective, standard React pattern

## Changes Made

**File**: `ui-new/src/components/ChatTab.tsx`

**Line 222-225** - Added setTimeout wrapper:

```tsx
// OLD:
handleSend(exampleText);

// NEW:
setTimeout(() => {
  handleSend(exampleText);
}, 0);
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Open the application**
   ```
   http://localhost:8081
   ```

2. **Send a query**
   - Type: "What is the capital of France?"
   - Wait for response

3. **Click an example**
   - Click any example button
   - Verify:
     - ✅ Old messages disappear immediately
     - ✅ Example query sends
     - ✅ Only new conversation visible
     - ✅ No flicker or ghost messages

```bash
cd ui-new && npm run build

## Related Issues

This completes the example reset feature chain:

1. ✅ Clear messages and system prompt (commit `af0ee0c`)
2. ✅ Clear toast notifications (commit `cc589dc`)
3. ✅ Fix race condition with setTimeout (commit `3becbb9`) ← **THIS FIX**

## Files Modified

- `ui-new/src/components/ChatTab.tsx` - Line 222-225

## Why This Works

The key insight is that **React batches state updates** for performance. Multiple `setState` calls in the same function are processed together in one render cycle. By using `setTimeout(fn, 0)`, we:

1. ✅ Let React batch all the state clearing
2. ✅ Process a single render with empty state
3. ✅ Then send the new message with clean slate

This is a common React pattern for scenarios where you need to ensure state updates have completed before taking action.

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Old messages no longer persist when clicking examples. State clearing now works correctly due to proper async handling.
