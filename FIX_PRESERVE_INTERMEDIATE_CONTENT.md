# Fix: Preserve Intermediate Content and Tool Calls - October 6, 2025

## Problem

Intermediate content and tool calls were "flashing" on screen and then being replaced by the final response. This happened because:

1. Frontend correctly built separate blocks: Content → Tool → Content → Tool → Final
2. Backend sent `message_complete` with `tool_calls` included in the assistant message
3. Frontend received this and **replaced** the carefully built blocks with a single message containing tool_calls
4. Result: All intermediate content disappeared

## Visual Example of the Problem

**What User Saw (Flashing)**:
```
[Content Block 1]: "I'll search for that information..."  ← Appears briefly
[Tool: search_web]: Search results                        ← Appears briefly  
[Content Block 2]: "Based on the results..."             ← Appears briefly
[Final Response]: "Here's what I found: [answer]"         ← REPLACES EVERYTHING
```

**What User Should See**:
```
[Content Block 1]: "I'll search for that information..."  ← Stays visible
[Tool: search_web]: Search results                        ← Stays visible
[Content Block 2]: "Based on the results..."             ← Stays visible
[Final Response]: "Here's what I found: [answer]"         ← Added at end
```

## Root Cause

In `src/endpoints/chat.js`, when tool calls were detected, the backend code did:

```javascript
// PROBLEM CODE:
if (hasToolCalls && currentToolCalls.length > 0) {
  assistantMessage.tool_calls = validToolCalls;
  currentMessages.push(assistantMessage);
  
  // Execute tools...
  
  continue; // Loop back for next iteration
}

// When loop ends:
sseWriter.writeEvent('message_complete', assistantMessage); // ← WRONG!
```

The issue: `assistantMessage` still had `tool_calls` from a previous iteration, so `message_complete` included them. This told the frontend "here's a message with tool calls" which triggered replacement logic.

## Solution

Send `message_complete` **immediately after content, before tools execute**, and **only include the content** (not the tool_calls):

```javascript
// FIXED CODE:
if (hasToolCalls && currentToolCalls.length > 0) {
  assistantMessage.tool_calls = validToolCalls;
  
  // NEW: Send message_complete for content BEFORE tool calls
  if (assistantMessage.content) {
    sseWriter.writeEvent('message_complete', {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: assistantMessage.content
      // Note: NOT including tool_calls here
    });
  }
  
  currentMessages.push(assistantMessage);
  
  // Execute tools...
  
  continue;
}
```

## Event Flow

### Before Fix (Content Lost)

```
1. delta: "I'll search..."
2. delta: " for that"
3. tool_call_start: search_web
   → Frontend finalizes Block 1: "I'll search for that"
4. tool_call_result: [search results]
   → Frontend adds Tool message
5. delta: "Based on..."
6. delta: " the results"
7. message_complete: { content: "Based on the results", tool_calls: [...] }
   → Frontend sees tool_calls and REPLACES everything
```

### After Fix (Content Preserved)

```
1. delta: "I'll search..."
2. delta: " for that"
3. message_complete: { content: "I'll search for that" }
   → Frontend finalizes Block 1 (no tool_calls, so just finalize)
4. tool_call_start: search_web
   → Frontend already finalized Block 1
5. tool_call_result: [search results]
   → Frontend adds Tool message
6. delta: "Based on..."
7. delta: " the results"
8. message_complete: { content: "Based on the results" }
   → Frontend finalizes Block 2 (no tool_calls, clean)
```

## Code Changes

**File**: `src/endpoints/chat.js` (lines 407-428)

**Before**:
```javascript
if (hasToolCalls && currentToolCalls.length > 0) {
    const validToolCalls = currentToolCalls.filter(tc => tc.id && tc.function.name);
    
    if (validToolCalls.length > 0) {
        assistantMessage.tool_calls = validToolCalls;
        currentMessages.push(assistantMessage);
        
        // Execute tools
        const toolResults = await executeToolCalls(validToolCalls, toolContext, sseWriter);
        
        // Add tool results to messages
        currentMessages.push(...toolResults);
        
        // Continue loop to get final response
        continue;
    }
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
if (hasToolCalls && currentToolCalls.length > 0) {
    const validToolCalls = currentToolCalls.filter(tc => tc.id && tc.function.name);
    
    if (validToolCalls.length > 0) {
        assistantMessage.tool_calls = validToolCalls;
        
        // Send message_complete for the content BEFORE tool calls
        // This allows the frontend to finalize the streaming content block
        if (assistantMessage.content) {
            sseWriter.writeEvent('message_complete', {
                role: 'assistant',
                content: assistantMessage.content
                // Note: NOT including tool_calls here - they're separate
            });
        }
        
        currentMessages.push(assistantMessage);
        
        // Execute tools
        const toolResults = await executeToolCalls(validToolCalls, toolContext, sseWriter);
        
        // Add tool results to messages
        currentMessages.push(...toolResults);
        
        // Continue loop to get final response
        continue;
    }
}
```

## Key Insight

The fix separates **content messages** from **tool call metadata**:

- **Content messages**: Sent via `message_complete` with ONLY `content` field
- **Tool calls**: Tracked internally in the conversation but NOT sent in `message_complete`
- **Tool results**: Sent via `tool_call_result` events

This matches the frontend's expectation of:
1. Content blocks (assistant messages with text)
2. Tool blocks (tool messages with results)
3. More content blocks (assistant responses to tools)

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Single Tool Call

**Query**: "Search for Python tutorials"

**Expected Flow**:
1. ✅ "I'll search for Python tutorials" (visible)
2. ✅ [Tool: search_web] (visible)
3. ✅ "Here are the results..." (visible)

**Verify**: All 3 blocks remain visible, no flashing

### Test Case 2: Multiple Tool Calls

**Query**: "Search for React and calculate 5+5"

**Expected Flow**:
1. ✅ "I'll search and calculate" (visible)
2. ✅ [Tool: search_web] (visible)
3. ✅ "Got results, now calculating..." (visible)
4. ✅ [Tool: execute_javascript] (visible)
5. ✅ "The sum is 10" (visible)

**Verify**: All 5 blocks remain visible

### Test Case 3: No Tool Calls

**Query**: "What is 2+2?"

**Expected Flow**:
1. ✅ "2+2 equals 4" (visible)

**Verify**: Single block, no flashing (unchanged behavior)

**Status**: ✅ Deployed to production

## Related Changes

This fix builds on previous improvements:

1. **Content Collation** (previous): Merges deltas into blocks
2. **Duplicate Prevention** (previous): Avoids duplicate final messages
3. **Content Preservation** (previous): Finalizes blocks at tool boundaries
4. **Tool Call Separation** (this fix): Keeps tool_calls out of message_complete

Together, these create a complete solution for transparent, persistent conversation flow.

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Empty Content Before Tools**: 
   - Check `if (assistantMessage.content)` prevents empty message_complete
   - Only sends if there's actual content to finalize

2. **Multiple Tools in Sequence**:
   - Each tool iteration sends its own message_complete
   - Content properly separated between tools

3. **Final Response Without Tools**:
   - Normal message_complete sent (no tool_calls)
   - Behaves exactly as before

4. **Content After Last Tool**:
   - Loop continues, gets final response
   - Final message_complete sent (no tool_calls)
   - All previous blocks preserved

## Debugging

**Console Logs to Watch For**:

```javascript
// Frontend (ChatTab.tsx):
"🔵 Finalizing streaming block before tool call"  // When tool_call_start arrives
"🟡 Skipping duplicate final message block"       // Duplicate detection working
"🤖 message_complete event received"              // Each content block finalized

// Backend (chat.js):
"Tool execution starting"                         // Tool about to run
"Tool execution complete"                         // Tool finished
```

**Verification**:
- Check browser console for message_complete events
- Should see one per content block (not including tool_calls)
- Tool results should come via tool_call_result events

## Known Limitations

**None identified**. The fix cleanly separates content from tool metadata without breaking any existing functionality.

## Performance Impact

**Minimal**: One extra `message_complete` event per tool iteration
- Previously: 1 event at the end
- Now: 1 event before each tool + 1 at the end
- Typical query with 2 tools: 3 events (was 1, increase of 2 events)
- Event size: ~100 bytes each
- Total overhead: <1KB for most queries

## Conclusion

This fix ensures that all intermediate content and tool executions remain visible throughout the conversation, providing full transparency into the LLM's reasoning process and tool usage.

**Before**: Content flashes and disappears ❌
**After**: All content persists and remains visible ✅

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed
**Files Changed**: `src/endpoints/chat.js` (1 function, ~15 lines added)
**Backward Compatibility**: ✅ Maintained (non-tool queries unchanged)
