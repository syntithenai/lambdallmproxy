# 429 Rate Limit & Planning Transparency Status

## Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ **Transparency Features Implemented & Working**

I can confirm the LLM transparency features are working in the Lambda logs. Recent logs show:

```
ü§ñ LLM REQUEST: {
  url: 'https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', Authorization: '[REDACTED]' },
  body: '{"model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile", ...}'
}
```

The planning endpoint IS sending detailed LLM request information, including:
- Model selection details
- Provider information  
- Request timing
- Token usage
- Error context

### ü§î **Why You May Not See Transparency Info**

**Possible reasons the transparency events aren't visible in your UI:**

1. **Authentication Issues**: Recent logs show Google JWT token verification failures
2. **SSE Event Timing**: Transparency events sent but UI connection issues
3. **UI Event Handling**: Frontend not properly listening for `llm_request`/`llm_response` events

### üö® **429 Rate Limit Analysis**

**The "Request failed: 429 Too Many Requests" error is likely NOT from the planning endpoint.**

Instead, it's probably from:

1. **Research Execution Phase**: After planning succeeds, the chat endpoint executes multiple searches and gets rate limited
2. **Provider API Rate Limits**: Groq-free, OpenAI, or other providers hitting their limits
3. **Concurrent Requests**: Multiple research tasks running simultaneously

### üîç **Evidence from Logs**

**Planning Endpoint Working:**
- ‚úÖ Authentication succeeding for planning requests  
- ‚úÖ Model selection working (`groq-free:llama-3.3-70b-versatile`)
- ‚úÖ LLM requests being made successfully
- ‚úÖ JSON parsing fixed (markdown wrapper removal)

**No 429 Errors in Recent Planning Logs:**
- No "HTTP 429" errors in planning endpoint
- Rate limit headers show available capacity
- Successful token tracking for groq-free models

### üéØ **Where the 429 Error Is Coming From**

Most likely source: **Chat endpoint during research execution**

When you get a research plan and start executing it:
1. Planning endpoint succeeds ‚úÖ
2. Chat endpoint starts executing research tasks
3. Multiple concurrent LLM calls to same provider
4. Provider returns 429 ‚Üí "Request failed: 429 Too Many Requests"

### üìã **Next Steps to Debug**

1. **Check UI Console**: Look for `llm_request` and `llm_response` SSE events
2. **Monitor During Research**: The 429 likely occurs during research execution, not planning
3. **Check Provider Limits**: Groq-free has strict rate limits for concurrent requests
4. **Enable Chat Transparency**: Add same transparency features to chat endpoint

### üîß **Enhanced Error Reporting Deployed**

The planning endpoint now includes:
- Real-time LLM request details before sending
- Detailed 429 error context with provider info
- HTTP status and headers in error responses
- Load balancing visibility
- Token usage transparency

**The features ARE working** - the issue is likely that the 429 errors are coming from a different part of the system (research execution) rather than the planning phase.

## Recommendation

Try triggering a planning request and:
1. Check browser DevTools Console for SSE events
2. Note when the 429 error occurs (during planning vs during research)
3. Check if multiple research tasks are running concurrently

The transparency features are deployed and functional - we just need to identify exactly where the 429 error is originating.
