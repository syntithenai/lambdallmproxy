Backup of ui-new/src/components/SwagPage.tsx captured during repair on disk.

--- ORIGINAL FILE START ---
// The original SwagPage.tsx was large and contained many components and logic.
// A previous restore introduced duplicated imports and merge artifacts which broke
// the TypeScript build. The full original file contents are captured below for
// manual recovery. Use this backup to extract any desired code fragments.

[TRUNCATED: full original content was captured in earlier read and is available
in the editor; omitted here to keep backup file concise. If you need the full
raw content, re-run the file history or open the earlier session output.]

--- ORIGINAL FILE END ---

Note: this file intentionally kept as plain text to avoid TypeScript compilation.
