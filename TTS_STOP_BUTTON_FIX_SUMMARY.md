# TTS Stop Button Fix - Summary

## Problem
The global TTS stop button (flashing red button in page header) appeared when reading snippets but clicking it did not properly stop playback. The button remained visible and the TTS state was stuck.

## Solution
Fixed the `stop()` method in TTS providers to properly trigger the `onEnd` callback, which resets the TTS context state.

## Changes

### 1. LLMProviderTTSProvider (`ui-new/src/services/tts/LLMProviderTTSProvider.ts`)
- Added `currentOnEnd` callback storage
- Store `onEnd` callback when audio starts
- Trigger callback in `stop()` method
- Clean up callback on natural end/error

### 2. ElevenLabsProvider (`ui-new/src/services/tts/ElevenLabsProvider.ts`)
- Same fix as LLMProviderTTSProvider

### 3. BrowserProviders
- Already had proper callback handling ✓

## How It Works Now

**Before:** 
- Click stop → Audio stops → Button stays visible → State stuck

**After:**
- Click stop → Audio stops → Callback triggered → State resets → Button disappears

## Testing

```bash
# Build
cd ui-new && npm run build

# Deploy
./scripts/deploy-docs.sh -m "fix: TTS stop button properly stops playback"
```

**Manual Test:**
1. Go to Swag page
2. View a snippet
3. Click "Read" button
4. Click flashing red stop button in header
5. ✓ Audio stops immediately
6. ✓ Button disappears
7. ✓ Can read again without refresh
